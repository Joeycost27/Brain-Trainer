Excited because you think you did really well	Nervous — your body is getting ready for something that matters	Hungry, which always makes hands sweaty	Sleepy, your body needs a nap	b	A fast heartbeat and sweaty hands are your body's signs of nervousness.

Think about how your body feels before something really matters.	10	emotions,body signals,anxiety
Q002	EMO	Identifying feelings	1	youth	Your friend gets the last biscuit and you do not. You feel a tight, hot feeling in your chest. What feeling is this?	Embarrassment — everyone saw that happen	Jealousy — that hot tight feeling when someone has something you wanted	Hunger — your body is just telling you it wants food	Tiredness — that feeling hits when you are low on energy	b	Jealousy is the feeling we get when someone else has something we want. It often sits right in your chest and feels hot or tight. It is completely normal — every human feels it. The trick is noticing it without letting it run the show.

Q004	EMO	Mixed emotions	2	youth	A classmate says something mean about you in front of everyone. Your face goes red and you want to shout. Which two feelings are you most likely experiencing?	Embarrassment and anger — both hit at once in moments like this	Boredom and surprise — you were not expecting it	Pride and frustration — your pride was hurt so you feel frustrated	Calm and shyness — you shut down instead of reacting	a	When someone is unkind in public, embarrassment (that is the red face) and anger (that is the wanting to shout) arrive together. Having two feelings at once is completely normal — your brain does not queue emotions neatly.	One feeling is about being seen. The other is about being treated unfairly.	20	emotions,embarrassment,anger,mixed feelings
Q005	EMO	Nervous excitement	2	youth	You are about to go on stage for the school show. Your tummy is full of butterflies. This feeling can actually HELP you perform because...	It burns off the extra food you ate at lunch	It means your body is giving you extra energy and sharper focus	It keeps you so busy thinking about it that you forget the hard parts	It makes the audience feel sorry for you	b	That butterfly feeling is your body giving you a performance boost — extra energy and heightened attention. Scientists call it nervous excitement and it genuinely improves performance when you reframe it that way.	Your body is getting you ready. How might extra energy actually help?	20	emotions,anxiety,performance,nervous excitement
Q006	EMO	Loss and grief	2	youth	Your best friend moves to a different school. Every day you miss them and feel heavy inside. What is this feeling?	Loneliness because you have no friends now	Grief or a sense of loss — the heavy feeling that comes when something important changes	Jealousy of the friends they are making at their new school	Boredom because there is less to do	b	When someone or something important leaves our life, we grieve it — even if nothing dramatic happened.

It feels bad on purpose — it is pushing you to make things right. That is actually useful, once you listen to it.	This feeling is your brain telling you something needs fixing.	20	emotions,guilt,responsibility,making things right
Q008	EMO	Calm and groundedness	3	youth	You feel calm, safe and settled. Your breathing is slow and your muscles feel relaxed. This feeling is called...	Tiredness — your body is shutting down for the night	Boredom — when nothing is happening you feel flat	Grounded — calm, present and settled in your own body	Numbness — when you have stopped feeling things properly	c	Feeling grounded means being calm, present and settled. It is the state where your brain works best — not anxious, not hyped up, just clear. Knowing what it feels like helps you notice when you have lost it.	This is the opposite of anxious. Think about standing firmly on both feet.	30	emotions,calm,regulation,grounded
Q009	SIT	Reading the room	1	youth	You walk into the classroom and everyone is sitting quietly while the teacher writes on the board. What should you do?

They are all thinking deeply about what you are saying	Their attention has drifted — they may not be very interested right now	They are being rude on purpose to teach you a lesson	They are waiting for the best bit before they react	b	When people look away or check their phones during your story, their attention has drifted. This is not always personal — but it is information. Noticing it means you can decide whether to change your approach or wrap it up.	What are people's eyes and bodies actually showing you?	20	situations,body language,social signals,attention
Q011	SIT	Timing	2	youth	You have brilliant news to share but your teacher looks very busy and stressed right now. What should you do?	Wait for a natural moment when they seem less pressured	Tell them immediately — good news always cheers people up	Say it loudly as you pass so they hear it without you stopping them	Send a friend over to tell them for you	a	Even the best news can land badly if the person is not ready to hear it. Waiting for the right moment is not about being less excited — it is about reading when someone can actually receive what you want to share.	Is right now actually a good moment for the other person?	20	situations,timing,emotional intelligence,empathy
Q012	SIT	Supporting friends	1	youth	Your friend has been very quiet all day and said no to playing at lunch. What is the best thing to do?	Gently ask if they are okay and let them know you noticed	Respect their space completely and ask nothing	Tell a teacher they are being strange today	Keep asking loudly until they say what is wrong	a	A gentle check-in says: I see you and I care.

What would you want someone to do if that was you?	10	situations,friendship,empathy,checking in
Q013	SIT	Reading the room	2	youth	You are in a meeting with the headteacher and your parent about something serious. You suddenly remember something funny. You should...	Save it for the right moment — this is not it	Tell it quickly — it will lighten the mood for everyone	Text a friend about it so you do not forget it	Leave the room to tell someone in the corridor	a	Reading the room means knowing when something is NOT the right moment — even for something funny. Saving it shows you can manage your own impulses and stay in the situation you are actually in.	Is this the right moment for a funny story?	20	situations,reading the room,impulse control,timing
Q014	SIT	Helping others save face	3	youth	At a family dinner, your aunty asks your cousin how school is going. Your cousin goes quiet and looks embarrassed. You know they have been struggling.

Q015	SIT	Self-awareness	3	youth	Every time you join a group conversation, the topic shifts and people edge away slightly. This pattern probably means...	Your timing or approach when joining conversations is not quite working yet — and it is worth exploring why	The group has a private joke that excludes newcomers	Everyone in the group is shy and uncomfortable generally	You are too clever for the conversations they are having	a	A pattern repeating is useful information. It does not mean you are disliked — it probably means something specific about how you are entering conversations. Are you jumping in loudly? Interrupting? Small adjustments can change everything.	Think about the how of joining — not just the fact that you joined.	30	situations,self-awareness,social skills,patterns
Q016	SIT	Generosity and awareness	2	youth	The teacher asks a question and your hand shoots up immediately. But you notice another student who rarely answers really wants a try today. What could you do?	Put your hand down and let the other student try	Keep your hand up — you were there first	Shout the answer quietly under your breath just in case	Tell the teacher the other student wants to go	a	Knowing the answer and choosing to let someone else have the moment shows real generosity. You already know it — giving them that experience costs you nothing and means everything to them.	You can be kind AND clever at exactly the same time.	20	situations,generosity,awareness,sharing
Q017	TASK	Getting started	1	youth	Your bedroom is very messy and it looks overwhelming. The best first step is...	Choose one small area — like just the desk — and start only there	Sit on your bed and think about the full plan before touching anything	Wait for someone to give you a clear order of what to tackle	Tidy a tiny bit and then watch TV as a first reward	a	Big tasks feel impossible until you break them into pieces. Starting with one small corner creates momentum — and momentum makes the next part easier. The hardest part is always starting.	Do not think about the whole room. Just pick one corner.	10	tasks,getting started,planning,breaking things down
Q018	TASK	Planning ahead	1	youth	You have a school project due on Friday. Today is Monday. The smartest first step is...	Start on Thursday evening — you will remember it better closer to the deadline	Break it into small steps and do one each day	Do the whole thing tonight while you have energy	Ask a friend to help you at the last minute on Friday	b	Spreading work across several days makes each piece feel manageable. Last-minute work causes stress and usually produces a worse result. A little each day is one of the most powerful habits you can build.	How many days do you have? What could you do on each one?	10	tasks,planning,time management,homework
Q019	TASK	Staying on task	2	youth	You are halfway through tidying your room and you spot your favourite book. What should you do?	Finish the tidy first, then enjoy the book as actual free time	Read one chapter — you can pick up where you left off	Hide the book so you forget it and keep going	Stop the tidy — reading is more educational anyway	a	The job is not done yet. One chapter almost always becomes more. Finishing first means the book is a real reward you earned — and it will feel better than a guilty interruption.	Finish what you started. Then the reward is real.	20	tasks,focus,staying on task,distraction
Q020	TASK	Logical ordering	1	youth	You need to pack your school bag for tomorrow. Which order makes the most sense?	Check what you need, find each thing, pack it, check again	Throw everything in that might be useful and sort it in the morning	Pack what you remember and text a friend to remind you of the rest	Ask a parent to do it since they remember everything	a	Good packing has a natural order: know what you need, find it, pack it, verify. This system means you almost never forget things and it takes under five minutes once it is a habit.	What do you need to know before you can decide what to pack?	10	tasks,organisation,packing,systems
Q021	TASK	Time estimation	2	youth	You planned to finish your homework in 20 minutes but it took 45. What should you do next time?	Add extra time when you plan — tasks almost always take longer than expected	Give up estimating since your brain is clearly bad at it	Start later so it does not matter how long it takes	Rush more so it actually fits in 20 minutes	a	Nearly everyone underestimates how long things take — especially adults. The trick is to learn from experience and build in extra time. Good planners know that a 20-minute task probably needs 35–40 minutes in reality.	What could you change about your estimate next time?	20	tasks,time management,estimation,planning
Q022	TASK	Priority under time pressure	3	youth	You have 15 minutes before school and three jobs: eat breakfast, find your PE kit and brush teeth. The best order is...	PE kit first since finding it is unpredictable, then breakfast, then teeth	Teeth first as they are quickest, then PE kit, then breakfast	Breakfast first since you are hungry — the rest will be fast	Do them in whatever order feels natural when you get up	a	When time is short, do the most uncertain task first. Finding a PE kit could take one minute or ten — you do not know. Do that while you have the most time, then the rest is quick and predictable.	Which task is least predictable? Do that one first.	30	tasks,planning,priority,time pressure
Q023	GOAL	Persistence	1	youth	You want to learn to ride a bike but you keep falling off. What should you do?	Keep practising a little each day — falling off is exactly how you learn	Give up and find a skill that comes more naturally	Only try again when you feel absolutely ready and confident	Watch videos of other people riding instead of actually practising	a	Every skill — riding, reading, drawing, sport — is learned through trying, failing and trying again. Every fall is information your brain and body are collecting. Progress happens through practice, not through waiting until you feel ready.	What do experts and beginners have in common?	10	goals,persistence,growth mindset,learning
Q024	GOAL	Bouncing back	2	youth	You set a goal to read one chapter every night. After three good nights you miss one. What should you do?	Pick up where you left off — one missed night does not end a goal	Start a completely new goal since this one is clearly not working	Give up — you already broke the streak so it does not count anymore	Read five chapters the next night to make up for the one you missed	a	Missing one day does not mean you have failed. Goals are patterns over time, not perfect streaks. Getting back on track after a miss is actually the most important part — that is what separates people who build habits from those who do not.	What matters more — one missed day or the whole pattern over time?	20	goals,resilience,setbacks,persistence
Q025	GOAL	SMART goals	2	youth	Which of these is the best-formed goal?	I want to get better at Maths and understand it properly	I will practise my times tables for ten minutes every day this week	I will be the best at everything at school by the end of term	I might try to do a bit more reading when I feel like it	b	Practising times tables for 10 minutes every day this week is specific, measurable and time-based. Vague goals like want to get better are hard to achieve because you can never tell if you actually did them.	Which option tells you exactly what to do, how much and by when?	20	goals,smart goals,planning,specificity
Q026	GOAL	Small steps	1	youth	You want to make a new friend. What is a good first small step?	Smile and say hello to one person who seems friendly	Introduce yourself to ten people at once to get it over with	Wait for someone to come to you — it will happen eventually	Tell everyone about yourself so they can decide if they like you	a	Big goals start with tiny actions.

What is the smallest possible thing you could do today?	10	goals,small steps,friendship,action
Q027	GOAL	Confidence and action	2	youth	You want to audition for the school play but you have never done it before and feel nervous. What is the most helpful thing to tell yourself?	Being nervous means it matters — I will try anyway and see what happens	I will wait until I feel fully confident before attempting something this big	I will probably fail so why put myself through it at all	Everyone else is much more experienced and I am not ready yet	a	Confidence comes from doing things, not from waiting until you feel ready. Nervousness is a signal that something matters to you — that is actually a good sign. Trying IS the brave act, not just succeeding.	Does confidence come before action or grow from it?	20	goals,confidence,courage,trying new things
Q028	MAN	Patience in public	1	youth	You are at a restaurant with your family. The food is taking ages and you are really hungry. What is the polite thing to do?	Wait patiently and find something to talk about while you wait	Complain loudly so the waiter knows you are still there	Ask every five minutes if it will be much longer	Say loudly that you are starving so the whole table hears	a	Patience in public is a real and valued skill.

How would the people around you feel with each of these choices?	10	manners,patience,public behaviour,restaurants
Q029	MAN	Saying thank you	1	youth	Someone holds a door open for you. What should you say?	Thank you — clearly and with eye contact	Nothing — they chose to hold it so it is their responsibility	Oh I nearly walked into that — funny!	You are very kind but you did not have to do that	a	Saying thank you when someone does something kind — even something small — is one of the most important social habits you can build. It makes the other person feel seen and appreciated. Two words, big effect.	Two little words. Always worth saying.	10	manners,thank you,gratitude,politeness
Q030	MAN	Receiving hospitality	1	youth	You are at a friend's house for dinner and you do not like the food. What is the polite response?	Eat a little of what you can and thank them for dinner	Tell them honestly it is not really your kind of thing	Eat as little as possible and push the rest around your plate	Ask if they have something else you could have instead	a	Someone made that meal and chose it for you. Eating a little and saying thank you honours their effort — even if it is not your favourite. It is one meal, and their kindness is more important than your preference right now.	Think about the effort that went into making that meal.	10	manners,hospitality,guests,gratitude
Q031	MAN	Accidents	1	youth	You accidentally bump into someone and knock their things over. What should you do?	Say sorry immediately and help pick things up	Keep walking — accidents do not count since you did not mean it	Blame the layout of the space for putting things in the way	Look away and hope they did not notice who it was	a	Accidents happen to everyone. Saying sorry and helping straight away shows you care about how your actions affect others — even when it was unintentional. It is one of the clearest signs of good character.	What would you want someone to do if they bumped into you?	10	manners,apologies,accidents,character
Q032	MAN	Listening properly	2	youth	You are in a conversation and you really want to share your point. The other person has not finished yet. What should you do?	Wait for a natural pause, then share your thought	Jump in — your point is relevant so the timing does not matter	Interrupt with sorry to interrupt but at least you warned them	Forget it — if you have to wait you will lose your train of thought	a	Interrupting — even politely — cuts the other person off before they have finished their thought. Waiting for a natural pause shows you are genuinely listening, not just counting down until your turn. This single habit transforms conversations.	Are you actually listening or just waiting to speak?	20	manners,listening,interrupting,conversations
Q033	MAN	Helping strangers	1	youth	A younger child at school is sitting alone and crying. You do not know them. What is the kind thing to do?	Go over calmly and ask if they are okay, or find an adult to help	Walk past — you do not know them and it is not your situation	Stare for a moment to check how serious it looks before deciding	Tell your friends about it so more people know	a	Noticing someone who is struggling and doing something about it — even something small — is one of the most important kinds of kindness. You do not have to fix anything. Just asking if they are okay can mean everything.	What would you hope someone would do if that was you?	10	manners,kindness,helping strangers,empathy
Q034	MAN	Receiving gifts	1	youth	You receive a birthday present that you do not like at all. What is the polite response?	Thank you so much — that is really kind of you!

Think about the giver, not just the gift.	10	manners,gifts,gratitude,social skills

Being aware of how much space your noise takes up — especially in cinemas, libraries or theatres — is a core part of being considerate.	Whose experience is being affected by how loud you are right now?	20	manners,public spaces,awareness,consideration
Q036	CARE	Listening to your body	1	youth	You have been on a screen for three hours. Your eyes feel tired and your neck aches. What should you do?	Take a break — go outside, move around and drink some water	Keep going since you are nearly at a good stopping point	Switch to TV instead since it is further away than a phone screen	Have a snack and get more comfortable so you can carry on	a	Your body sends clear signals when it needs a break. Tired eyes and an aching neck are messages. Stepping away and moving around resets both your brain and your body — and the thing you were doing will still be there when you get back.	What is your body trying to tell you right now?	10	self-care,screen time,body signals,breaks
Q037	CARE	Morning habits	1	youth	You wake up feeling grumpy and tired. Which morning habit would most help you feel better?	Eat a proper breakfast, drink water and get some fresh air if possible	Skip breakfast to get those extra precious minutes of sleep	Check your phone immediately to see if anything good happened overnight	Stay in bed until the last possible moment	a	Your brain runs on fuel — food and water.

What does your brain and body actually need to work well?	10	self-care,morning routine,food,habits
Q038	CARE	Recovering after a hard day	2	youth	You have had a really difficult day at school and feel tired and emotional. What is the best first step when you get home?	Have a snack and a few quiet minutes before deciding what to do next	Go straight onto screens to give your brain a complete break	Do homework immediately while the day is still fresh in your mind	Tell everyone about your difficult day to process it out loud	a	After a hard day your brain and body need time to recover before you make good decisions about what to do next.

What does your body need right after a really demanding day?	20	self-care,recovery,decompression,emotional regulation
Q039	CARE	Sleep hygiene	2	youth	You need to sleep but you are looking at your phone and you are not tired. The best thing to do is...	Put the phone in another room 30 minutes before sleep and do something calm instead	Keep going until you genuinely feel tired — forcing sleep does not work	Turn the brightness right down so the screen is less stimulating	Switch to TV since the bigger screen is further from your eyes	a	Phone screens produce blue light that tells your brain to stay awake — even when you want to sleep. Putting the phone away and doing something calm allows your brain to switch into sleep mode. This is one of the most effective sleep habits you can build.	What is the screen doing to your brain's sleep signals right now?	20	self-care,sleep,screen time,habits
Q040	CARE	Managing worries	2	youth	You feel anxious about something happening tomorrow and cannot stop thinking about it. What is a helpful thing to do tonight?

Moving the thought from your head onto paper tells your brain the worry is safe and will not be forgotten — so your brain is much more willing to let go of it.	What happens when you keep a worry circling inside your head?	20	self-care,anxiety,worry,sleep
Q041	THINK	Pause before reacting	1	youth	You are playing a board game and your friend makes a move that does not feel fair. Your first instinct is to flip the board. What should you do instead?	Take a breath, pause for three seconds, then calmly say it does not feel fair	Flip the board — they deserve the consequence	Quietly knock a few pieces to show how you feel	Go completely silent and refuse to play further	a	The pause between feeling something and doing something is where your best choices live. Three seconds is enough time to stop a reaction you would regret. Saying how you feel calmly is far more powerful than flipping a board.	What happens if you count to three before you do anything?	10	think first,impulse control,pause,reactions
Q042	THINK	Responding vs reacting	2	youth	Someone says something mean about you in front of friends. You feel furious. The best immediate action is...	Remove yourself for a couple of minutes, breathe, then decide how to respond	Say something equally sharp straight back so they know you are not a pushover	React immediately so they see it landed — staying silent looks like agreement	Tell everyone what they said so the group knows what happened	a	Reacting immediately when furious almost always makes things worse. Two minutes away lets your brain's thinking part come back online. Then you can choose your response instead of just reacting.	What is the difference between reacting and responding?	20	think first,impulse control,anger,response
Q043	THINK	Checking before taking	1	youth	You are hungry and you see a biscuit left out on the kitchen counter. You are not sure if it belongs to someone. What should you do?	Ask first before taking it — five seconds of asking avoids a much bigger problem	Eat it — if it is just sitting there it is up for grabs	Take half and leave half so it seems like you barely touched it	Eat it quickly and say nothing — what they do not know will not hurt them	a	When you are not sure if something belongs to someone, asking takes five seconds and builds trust. Taking things that might belong to others — even small things — can damage relationships even when it was genuinely not intentional.	What is the cost of asking? What is the cost of not asking?	10	think first,honesty,checking,trust
Q044	THINK	Letting people finish	2	youth	You are listening to a friend talk and what they say reminds you of your own story. You want to redirect immediately. You should...	Let them finish their thought, then share your story naturally	Change the subject — your story is relevant so it fits perfectly	Jump in with oh that reminds me — the connection is worth noting	Forget your story since it was probably not that relevant anyway	a	Letting someone finish before you redirect is a mark of genuine respect. It tells them: what you are saying actually matters to me. This single habit makes you noticeably better to talk to.	Finish their thought first. Then share yours.	20	think first,listening,impulse control,conversations
Q045	THINK	Handling mistakes	1	youth	You get a question wrong in class and feel embarrassed and frustrated. What should you do?	Take a breath and remind yourself that getting things wrong is how you learn	Say the rude thing under your breath just quietly enough	Argue that the question was unclear and you were not really wrong	Refuse to answer questions for the rest of the lesson	a	Getting things wrong is not a disaster — it is information your brain is using. Every mistake your brain makes and then corrects actually helps you remember better in the long run.	What do mistakes actually do to your brain?	10	think first,resilience,mistakes,learning
Q046	THINK	Queue jumping	2	youth	You are in a long queue and someone pushes in front of you. You feel a wave of anger rising. Before doing anything, you should...	Take a slow breath and decide calmly whether or how to say something	Push back immediately — consequences belong to people who push in	Shout at them to go to the back since everyone in the queue heard it too	Walk away from the queue entirely so you do not have to deal with it	a	The queue-jumper might not have noticed, might be in a rush, or might just be thoughtless. A slow breath gives you space to choose your response — and a calm response is almost always more effective.	Choose your response. Do not just react.	20	think first,anger,queues,calmness
Q047	THINK	In a minute	2	youth	Your mum asks you to help with the washing up. You are mid-game. You say in a minute. What actually tends to happen?	In a minute usually becomes much longer, the task is forgotten, and someone ends up frustrated	You finish the game at a natural stopping point and help straight away	Your mum does it herself and everything is fine	You remember in five minutes and it only takes two minutes anyway	a	In a minute is one of the most common delay tactics. When we are enjoying something our brain does not want to stop — and a minute stretches. Getting up and helping immediately takes less than five minutes and avoids a conflict that takes much longer to recover from.	How long does in a minute usually actually last?	20	think first,delay,helping,family
Q048	THINK	Angry messages	3	youth	You are about to send a very angry text message to a friend after an argument. The best first step is...	Write it out but wait ten minutes before deciding whether to actually send it	Send it immediately — they need to know how you feel while you feel it	Make the message longer and more detailed so there is no misunderstanding	Get someone else to send it so it does not look like it came from you	a	The ten-minute rule for messages is one of the most useful tools there is. In ten minutes your feelings often reduce and you might change what you send — or decide not to send anything at all. Words in anger cause damage that takes far longer than ten minutes to repair.	Will you feel exactly the same way in ten minutes?	30	think first,anger,messages,consequences
Q049	FOCUS	Managing distraction	2	youth	You need to do your homework but your phone keeps buzzing. The best thing to do is...	Put your phone face down in another room until the homework is done	Check every message as it arrives and then refocus each time	Turn the volume down but keep it close so you do not miss anything urgent	Set a rule to only check every five minutes as a structured break	a	Every notification breaks your concentration — and research shows it takes several minutes to fully refocus after each interruption. Putting the phone out of reach removes the temptation completely. Short focused bursts beat long distracted sessions every single time.	What happens to your focus every time you check a notification?	20	focus,distraction,phones,homework
Q050	FOCUS	Mind wandering	1	youth	You have been trying to read for ten minutes and your mind keeps drifting. The best response is...	Notice your mind wandered, gently bring it back to the page and try again	Give up — you clearly cannot focus today and forcing it makes it worse	Read the same sentence over and over until your brain actually takes it in	Read faster so you finish before your mind has time to wander	a	Mind wandering while reading is completely normal — every human mind wanders. The skill is noticing when it has happened and bringing yourself gently back. Every single time you do that you are practising and strengthening your focus. The wandering is not the failure. Giving up is.	What should you do the moment you notice your mind has drifted?	10	focus,mind wandering,reading,attention
Q051	SIT	Reading dominance	2	youth	You walk into a room and one person is doing most of the talking. Others glance at them before they speak. One person stopped mid-sentence when that person looked over. What is happening?	One person has a lot of social power in this group and the others are following their lead	Everyone is just being polite and taking careful turns	The quiet people are all naturally shy in groups	They were all waiting for you to arrive before starting properly	a	When one person holds a lot of social power in a group, you can see it before anyone says anything. Others check their reactions and look for permission. Noticing this is not paranoia — it is reading the room. Understanding a situation clearly is always the first step.	Watch the quiet people more than the loud one.	20	situations,group dynamics,social power,reading the room
Q052	SIT	Recognising pressure	1	youth	Your friend group has decided something and everyone agrees — except you. Everyone turns and looks at you expecting you to agree too. The pressure you feel is...	Your body warning you that your opinion is about to get overridden — and you have a choice to make	Proof that you should go along with it since everyone else cannot be wrong	A sign you are too sensitive and reading too much into a glance	Excitement because you like being the centre of attention	a	That pressure feeling — the weight of everyone's expectation — is your body signalling that something matters here. Your opinion is real. You do not have to agree just because everyone turned to look at you.	Your body felt it before your brain named it. What was it telling you?	10	situations,peer pressure,group dynamics,identity
Q053	SIT	The loudest voice	2	youth	In a group project, one person immediately starts telling everyone what to do without asking for anyone else's ideas. You have a different idea. What is the best way to handle this?	Say clearly but calmly: before we start, can we hear everyone's ideas quickly?	Stay quiet — they seem confident and confidence is usually a good sign	Argue loudly that your idea is better and explain why at length	Start doing things your own way quietly so both plans run in parallel	a	The loudest person is not automatically the person with the best idea. Asking to hear everyone's ideas is not a challenge — it is good leadership. It is also one of the most effective ways to contribute without a confrontation.	You do not have to fight the loud voice. You can redirect the room.	20	situations,group dynamics,assertiveness,leadership
Q054	SIT	When the room goes quiet	2	youth	A teacher asks who made a mess. The class goes silent. You notice one person shifting in their seat and avoiding eye contact. What does their body language suggest?	Their body is showing discomfort in a specific way — physical signals often speak before words do	Nothing — everyone looks uncomfortable when trouble is in the air	They are probably cold and just wriggling to warm up	They are about to put their hand up and explain themselves	a	Bodies speak before mouths do. Shifting, avoiding eye contact, suddenly very still — these are signals that someone is uncomfortable in a particular way. Noticing this is a real skill that helps you understand what is actually happening in a room.	What is their body doing that their words are not saying?	20	situations,body language,reading signals,awareness
Q055	EMO	Freeze response	2	youth	A teacher calls on you unexpectedly. Your mind goes completely blank even though you knew the answer a moment ago. This is most likely...	A freeze response — your brain briefly switched into protection mode under sudden pressure	Proof that you did not know the answer as well as you thought you did	A sign you need more sleep — tiredness kills recall	What happens when you were not really listening earlier in the lesson	a	When something feels threatening — even something as small as being put on the spot — your brain can briefly switch from thinking mode into survival mode. This is called a freeze response. It does not mean you do not know the answer. It means your brain needed a moment to feel safe.	This is your brain protecting you — not failing you.	20	emotions,freeze response,anxiety,brain science
Q056	EMO	Body signals as data	1	youth	You are about to do something and your stomach feels tight, your breathing gets shallow and you want to leave. What is happening?	Your body is running a quick safety check and flagging something worth paying attention to	You probably ate something that disagreed with you at lunch	You are tired and your body is asking for rest before anything demanding	Your body always does this — it is not connected to what is happening	a	Your body runs a faster security check than your thinking brain does. That tight stomach and shallow breathing is your nervous system saying: wait, something here needs more attention. It is worth noticing — even if it turns out to be nothing.	Your body knows things before your brain catches up. What is it sensing?	10	emotions,body signals,intuition,safety
Q057	EMO	Shrinking feeling	2	youth	A confident older student makes a cutting comment about you in front of a group. You feel yourself wanting to get smaller and disappear. This urge to shrink is...	A completely normal response to social threat — and it does not mean what they said is true	Your body confirming that they had a point and you should pay attention	A sign that you need to toughen up and stop letting things get to you	What everyone in the room is secretly thinking about you too	a	The urge to shrink when someone says something critical is your nervous system responding to social threat. It is automatic and very human. But the urge to shrink is not a verdict on whether what was said was true. Those are two completely separate things.	The urge to shrink is automatic. What you do next is yours to choose.	20	emotions,social threat,confidence,self-worth
Q058	EMO	Disproportionate reaction	3	youth	Something small happens — a classmate takes the last seat you were heading for — and you feel a huge wave of anger, way bigger than the situation. This most likely means...	That small moment probably triggered a bigger feeling that was already there — reactions are sometimes bigger than the current moment	You are a naturally more reactive person than most and that is just how you are wired	You have a particularly strong sense of fairness which makes small injustices hit harder	You are genuinely very hungry and low blood sugar makes everything worse	a	Big reactions to small triggers almost always mean something older is underneath. The seat was not really the problem — it touched something bigger. The present moment is not always the actual cause of a strong feeling.	The feeling was bigger than the moment. What else might have been inside it?	30	emotions,triggers,disproportionate reactions,self-awareness
Q059	THINK	Holding your ground	2	youth	A dominant kid dismisses your idea in front of everyone by laughing at it. You know the idea is actually good. The strongest response is...	Say calmly: I still think it is worth thinking about — then let it sit	Immediately take the idea back and pretend you never cared about it	Argue loudly and in detail why they are wrong about your idea	Go quiet for the rest of the lesson so they know you are not happy	a	Staying calm and simply standing by your idea — without escalating and without collapsing — is extremely powerful. You are not arguing. You are not backing down. You are just still there. That quiet persistence is much harder to dismiss than a shouting match.	You do not need to fight to stay standing.	20	think first,assertiveness,resilience,social confidence
Q060	THINK	The follower pull	2	youth	You have your own opinion but everyone around you is nodding along to something you disagree with. You feel the pull to nod too. Before you nod, the most important question is...	Am I changing my view because of new information or just because of social pressure?	Will anyone actually notice if I do not nod along this one time?	Is there a polite way to half-nod so I do not fully commit?	What is the social cost of being the only person who does not nod?	a	Numbers are not the same as truth. A hundred people agreeing with something wrong does not make it right. The pull to nod and fit in is strong and human — but the question worth asking is whether you are changing your mind or just your expression.	Are you changing your mind or just changing your face?	20	think first,peer pressure,critical thinking,identity
Q061	SIT	Who controls the mood	3	youth	You notice that when one person in your group is happy, everyone relaxes. When they are in a bad mood, everyone walks on eggshells. This pattern tells you...	One person has an unusually large amount of emotional control over this group — and that is worth noticing	This is just normal group behaviour since every group has a natural mood-setter	The group is extremely empathetic which is actually a positive quality	Everyone in the group is just going through similar things at the same time	a	When one person's mood sets the emotional temperature for a whole group, that is a significant amount of power — and often a significant amount of pressure on everyone else. Noticing it is the first step to deciding whether you follow that temperature or set your own.	Who sets the weather in your group?	30	situations,group dynamics,emotional control,awareness
Q062	SIT	Testing behaviour	2	youth	Someone in your group makes a comment that seems like a joke but is aimed directly at you. Everyone laughs. Then they watch to see how you react. What is probably happening?	They are testing how you respond to being targeted — your reaction will teach them how to treat you	They are genuinely just joking and the watching after is completely coincidental	They do this to everyone so it is not personal — you were just next	They want to see if you have a good sense of humour about yourself	a	Some dominant behaviour comes in the form of jokes. The joke is the test — how do you react? If you shrink or perform being hurt, it signals one thing. If you stay calm without becoming rigid, it signals another. Your response teaches people what to expect.	What are they actually watching for?	20	situations,testing behaviour,group dynamics,resilience
Q063	SIT	The quiet ally	2	youth	You notice that one person in your group always agrees with the dominant person, even when they clearly do not believe what they are saying. This person is most likely...	Managing their own safety in the group by staying on the dominant person's good side	Telling the complete truth and actually agreeing with everything said	Very confident and comfortable with whatever the group decides	Simply very agreeable by nature and not bothered either way	a	Staying safe in a group sometimes means performing agreement even when you disagree. This is not weakness — it is often a rational response to feeling unsafe. Understanding why people go along with things helps you see the full picture of what is happening, not just the surface.	What is that person protecting by agreeing?	20	situations,group dynamics,social safety,empathy
Q064	EMO	Anxiety vs excitement	2	youth	You are about to do something important. Your heart is beating fast, your stomach is nervous and you have a lot of energy. You cannot tell if you are excited or anxious. This is because...	Anxiety and excitement feel almost identical in the body — the difference is mostly the story you put on top	You are definitely anxious since excitement feels lighter and more pleasant than this	Your body has not yet decided which emotion to run so it is running both at once	This always happens before important things and cannot be changed or reframed	a	Anxiety and excitement produce almost the same physical response — fast heart rate, adrenaline, heightened attention. The difference is the story you put on top. Telling yourself I am excited rather than I am anxious has been shown to genuinely improve performance.	What if this fast heart rate was energy, not fear?	20	emotions,anxiety,excitement,reframing
Q065	EMO	Safe person recognition	1	youth	When you walk into a room you feel more relaxed near some people and more tense near others — without knowing exactly why. This is...	Your nervous system doing a rapid safety check based on what it has learned from experience	Random and completely meaningless — feelings like that are just background noise	A sign you are prejudging people unfairly before you know them	Probably connected to whether you are hungry or tired rather than the people themselves	a	Your nervous system builds a database of experience — who has been kind, who has been unpredictable, who has been safe. It checks new situations against this database automatically and quickly. That relaxed or tense feeling is not random. It is your system telling you what it has learned.	Your nervous system did that check before your thinking brain did.	10	emotions,safety,nervous system,intuition
Q066	THINK	Not taking the bait	3	youth	Someone says something provocative to you in front of a group — clearly trying to get a reaction. The most powerful response is...	Stay calm, acknowledge it briefly and move on — giving a non-reaction takes away their ammunition	Argue back forcefully so people see you are not someone who gets pushed around	React visibly so the group knows how much it landed and what kind of person said it	Walk away without a word so everyone sees you are above responding	a	Provocation is designed to produce a reaction that makes the provoked person look emotional and the provoker look in control. Not reacting does not mean you agree — it means you understood the game and chose not to play. Calm acknowledgement and moving on is a skill most adults never fully master.	What does not reacting take away from them?	30	think first,provocation,self-control,group dynamics
Q067	THINK	Borrowed confidence	2	youth	You notice that a kid who dominates your group is only loud and dominant when their friends are around. Alone, they are noticeably quieter and more uncertain. This tells you...	Their confidence is partly borrowed from the group — it is not as solid as it looks when they have an audience	They have two completely different personalities and neither one is the real them	They are extremely good at reading what each social situation requires of them	Their behaviour at school is fake and everything about them at home is different	a	A lot of dominant behaviour is performed for an audience. The same person in a one-to-one situation is often quite different — more uncertain, more human. Understanding this does not mean you trust them automatically. It means their dominance is less about them being powerful and more about the group setting that up.	Who are they performing for?	20	think first,understanding others,group dynamics,confidence
Q068	SIT	Reading exclusion	2	youth	You walk up to your classmates and the conversation changes slightly — the topic shifts, people glance at each other, someone moves to close the circle a little. What is probably happening?	The group is managing something they do not want you to hear right now	You are misreading a totally coincidental moment of natural conversation change	Everyone suddenly had the same new thought at the same moment you arrived	They genuinely did not notice you walking over until now	a	Exclusion is often silent — a shift in body language, a closed circle, a change of topic. Noticing these signals is not paranoia. It is information. What you do with that information is up to you. But not noticing it leaves you walking into situations without the full picture.	What changed the moment you arrived?	20	situations,exclusion,reading signals,self-protection
Q069	SIT	Fair witness	3	youth	Someone tells you something bad about a person who is not there to speak for themselves. You feel yourself immediately believing it. Before fully accepting it, the fairest thing to do is...	Recognise you are only hearing one side and hold the judgement loosely until you know more	Believe it since the person telling you is your friend and they have no reason to lie	Tell the person being talked about so they have a chance to know and respond	Ask the person telling you for more detail so you have the full picture from their angle	a	A fair witness waits for enough information before deciding. When someone tells you something about another person, they are giving you one version of reality — filtered through their feelings and their reasons for telling you. This does not mean they are lying. It means you only have one piece of a bigger picture.	You only heard one side. What might the other side include?	30	situations,fairness,gossip,critical thinking,judgement
Q070	EMO	Feeling flat after conflict	2	youth	After an argument with a friend, you feel flat, exhausted and a bit empty — even though you might have won the argument. This feeling is...	A normal emotional come-down — conflict uses a lot of energy and your body needs to recover	Proof that you feel guilty about something you said in the argument	A sign the argument was not worth having since you feel worse not better	Strange and something to mention to an adult since it should not happen	a	Conflict activates your stress response — adrenaline, heightened alertness, fast thinking. When it ends, those chemicals reduce and your body can feel flat or drained. This is completely normal. It is also why rest after a hard social moment genuinely helps.	Your body just ran a lot of emotional energy. Of course it needs to recover.	20	emotions,conflict,recovery,body signals
Q071	THINK	Standing still	2	youth	The dominant person in your group is pushing everyone to pick a side in an argument. You have not decided what you think yet. The best response is...	Say clearly: I have not decided yet — I want to think about it first	Pick a side quickly so you are not left awkward and unsure in the middle	Pretend to agree so the pressure goes away without a confrontation	Leave the group until the argument has resolved itself	a	Not having formed an opinion yet is a completely valid position. Saying I have not decided is honest, confident and refuses to be rushed. Groups sometimes create urgency around choosing sides that does not actually exist. You are allowed to take time.	Not deciding yet is different from not caring.	20	think first,independence,peer pressure,critical thinking
Q072	SIT	The group norm check	2	youth	Your friend group has an unspoken rule that everyone makes fun of a certain type of thing. You never agreed to it but you went along because everyone else did. This is called...	A group norm — an unwritten rule the group enforces without ever officially agreeing on it	Just fitting in, which every healthy social group requires of its members	A natural shared sense of humour that developed over time	Good teamwork since shared preferences bring groups together	a	Group norms are invisible rules that form gradually without anyone deciding on them. They can be positive or negative. The important thing is noticing them. Once you name a group norm you are part of, you can decide if it is one you would actually choose.	Did you ever actually agree to this rule?	20	situations,group norms,social behaviour,identity
Q073	EMO	Feeling responsible for others' moods	2	youth	When someone close to you is in a bad mood, you feel anxious and try to fix it even though you did not cause it. This is...	A learned response — you have probably learned that someone's bad mood could affect you, so you manage it in advance	Simply being a caring person who looks out for the feelings of people they love	Evidence that you are an empath and feel things more deeply than most people	A sign of strong emotional intelligence and the ability to read people well	a	When we grow up around unpredictable moods, our nervous system can learn to scan for emotional temperature and start managing it before anything happens. This is a useful survival tool that can also be exhausting and unfair to yourself. Noticing the pattern is the first step to choosing when to step in.	Whose mood is it? Whose job is it to manage it?	20	emotions,responsibility,patterns,emotional safety
Q074	THINK	The compliment that feels wrong	2	youth	Someone gives you a compliment and instead of feeling good, something about it makes you feel slightly uncomfortable. You should...	Notice that feeling as information — sometimes compliments are used to soften someone up before a request	Ignore the feeling since a compliment is always a positive thing whatever the motive	Thank them and immediately be prepared to do whatever they are about to ask	Tell them directly that their compliment felt slightly off and ask what they actually want	a	Compliments can be genuine — and they can also be social tools used to create goodwill before making a request. Your slight discomfort is worth noticing. It does not mean the compliment was definitely manipulative. It means pay attention to what comes next.	Notice the feeling. Then watch what comes after the compliment.	20	think first,manipulation,social awareness,intuition
Q075	SIT	When silence means something	2	youth	You say something honest in a group and instead of a response there is a pause and a few people exchange glances. This silence probably means...	Something you said landed differently to what you expected — it surprised people or touched something uncomfortable	Everyone is genuinely thinking hard about what you said which is a good sign	The group has a technical difficulty with hearing you clearly and needs a moment	Everyone completely agrees with you and the silence is a form of collective respect	a	Silence and glances after you speak are information. They are not always negative — but they tell you something unexpected happened. Maybe you contradicted an unspoken group belief or named something people were avoiding. Sitting with that moment rather than immediately trying to undo what you said is a real skill.	What might your words have touched that was already sitting there?	20	situations,silence,reading the room,group dynamics
Q076	THINK	The strong inner voice	3	youth	You are in a difficult social situation and everyone is looking at you to react. You feel confused and pressured. The most useful thing to access is...	A quiet, clear sense of what you actually think and feel, separate from the noise of the moment	What the dominant person in the group wants you to do right now	The funniest possible response since humour always defuses pressure	What the group expects and the quickest way to give them that	a	The strong inner voice is not the loudest or most confident-sounding voice. It is the one underneath the noise — the one that knows what you actually think and feel when you stop performing. Getting to it under pressure takes practice. But it is always there.	Underneath the pressure and the noise — what do you actually think?	30	think first,identity,self-awareness,confidence
Q077	EMO	Feeling out of place	1	youth	You are in a group and you feel like you do not quite fit — like everyone else understands something you do not. This feeling is...	Almost universal — most people in most groups feel this way sometimes, even the ones who look most at ease	Proof that you do not really belong with this particular group of people	Only felt by people who are genuinely different or on the outside of things	A sign the group is not welcoming and you would be better off somewhere else	a	The feeling of not quite belonging in a group is one of the most common human feelings there is. The people who look most comfortable are almost certainly managing their own version of it. It does not mean you are wrong for the group. It often means the group has not yet done enough work to make everyone feel genuinely included.	If you could see inside the other people's heads right now, what might you find?	10	emotions,belonging,social anxiety,universality
Q078	SIT	Name what you see	3	youth	A dominant classmate keeps interrupting you specifically when you speak, but does not interrupt others. You have noticed this pattern over several days. The most useful first step is...	Name the behaviour clearly to yourself: they interrupt me specifically — that is a pattern not an accident	Ignore it since bringing it up will almost certainly make things worse for you	Tell everyone in the group about the pattern so they can see it happening too	Interrupt them back as often as possible so they experience how it feels	a	Before you can respond to a pattern, you need to name it precisely to yourself. Not they are horrible — that is a feeling. But they interrupt me specifically and repeatedly while not interrupting others — that is an observation. From that place of clarity, you can decide how or whether to address it.	Name the behaviour precisely. Separate it from the feeling it gives you.	30	situations,patterns,naming behaviour,assertiveness
Q079	EMO	The mask at school	3	youth	You feel like you perform a version of yourself at school that is quite different from who you are at home. This is...	Common and often necessary — but worth checking if the school version ever costs you too much energy	Proof that you are being dishonest and presenting a false version of yourself to people	Something all confident people figure out how to stop doing as they get older	A sign that school is the wrong environment for who you genuinely are	a	Most people carry different versions of themselves in different settings — and that is often appropriate. The question is not whether you have a school version but whether that version is exhausting or feels very far from who you actually are. That gap, if it is large, is worth understanding.	How far is your school version from your home version? What is the distance costing you?	30	emotions,identity,performance,self-awareness
Q080	THINK	Choosing your battles	2	youth	Someone in your class says something factually wrong and slightly dismissive about something you care about. You could correct them publicly. You should...	Consider the size of the error, the relationship and whether speaking will actually help — then choose	Always correct people — truth matters too much to let things slide	Always stay quiet in situations like this since starting an argument is never worth it	Correct them privately afterwards since public corrections always go badly	a	Not every wrong thing needs to be corrected out loud by you in that moment. The question is: does speaking here serve the truth, or does it serve your need to be right? Choosing which moments to speak and which to let go is a sign of real emotional maturity.	What will actually happen if you speak? What do you want from it?	20	think first,assertiveness,judgement,choosing battles
Q081	SIT	Recognising manipulation	3	youth	Someone keeps making you feel guilty for not spending more time with them, even when you have good reasons. They use phrases like you never care and you always choose others. This pattern is...	A guilt-based pattern using exaggerated language to make you fully responsible for their feelings	Just being honest about how much they miss you which is actually a compliment	Proof that you genuinely have not been there for them enough and should adjust your behaviour	A fair reaction that shows how much they value your friendship and want to protect it	a	Language like always and never during conflict is rarely literally true — but it is emotionally effective because it makes you feel completely responsible. This pattern makes it hard to maintain healthy limits because every boundary you set becomes evidence that you do not care. Noticing this language is the first step.	Always and never are rarely true. What is the pattern trying to achieve?	30	situations,manipulation,guilt,boundaries
Q082	EMO	After being left out	1	youth	You were not invited to something all your friends went to. You find out after. The hollow heavy feeling you have is...	Hurt — a real and valid emotion that comes from feeling you did not matter enough to be included	Jealousy of the fun they had without you rather than any deeper feeling about yourself	Anger at your friends for being thoughtless and not including you	A sign you should spend less time with people who can make you feel this way	a	Being left out genuinely hurts. Belonging matters to human beings in a deep, biological way. The hollow feeling is your system registering that something important to it was missing. You do not have to pretend it does not hurt — and you also do not have to decide immediately what it means.	The feeling is valid. What you decide it means is still open.	10	emotions,exclusion,hurt,belonging
Q083	THINK	Saying less	2	youth	You are in a conflict and you have a lot you want to say. You feel the urge to explain, justify and defend at length. The most effective choice is usually...	Say the most important thing clearly and once — then stop talking	Say everything you have prepared since more information means more clarity	Repeat your key point several times in different ways until they understand	Say nothing at all since any words will be used against you somehow	a	Over-explaining during conflict often weakens your position rather than strengthening it. It can look like anxiety — like you need to convince rather than simply state what is true. Saying the key thing clearly and then going quiet is powerful. It puts the next move on them.	Say the important thing. Then stop. Let the silence work.	20	think first,conflict,assertiveness,communication
Q084	SIT	Kindness that controls	3	youth	Someone is very kind to you — always there, always helping, always giving. But every time you try to do something independently, they seem hurt or step in to help before you can. This pattern is...	Kindness that also keeps you dependent on them — controlling through care rather than through threat	True friendship since real friends want to be there for you as much as possible	Evidence that they are more capable than you at most things and are just trying to help	Something you should feel grateful for since most people wish they had support like that	a	Controlling behaviour does not always look threatening. Sometimes it comes wrapped in generosity and concern. The tell is what happens when you try to be independent. If someone's kindness turns wounded when you do not need them, that is information about what the kindness is actually for.	What happens to their kindness when you do not need it?	30	situations,controlling behaviour,relationships,independence
Q085	EMO	The calm after the storm	2	youth	After something difficult — an argument, a scary moment, a hard conversation — your body feels shaky and strange. This is...	A completely normal physical response as your body's stress hormones gradually reduce after a period of high alert	A sign something might be medically wrong and it is worth mentioning to an adult	Proof the situation was even harder than you realised while you were in it	An emotional reaction that shows you were more invested in the outcome than you should have been	a	Your stress response is a physical system — it raises heart rate, releases hormones and sharpens alertness. Coming down from it takes time and produces physical sensations: shaking, strange tiredness, hollow feelings. This is your biology doing exactly what it should. Rest and warmth help.	Your body was running very hot. What does it need now?	20	emotions,stress response,recovery,body awareness
Q086	SIT	Changing the energy	3	youth	The mood in your friend group has gradually become more negative — more complaining, more putting people down, more cynicism. You have noticed it drifting this way over weeks. You could...	Introduce something different — a question, a positive observation, a funny story — and see if the energy follows	Say nothing since you are not in charge of the group's mood and it would look strange	Announce that the group has become too negative and something needs to change	Spend less time with the group until the mood improves on its own	a	Group moods drift and accumulate from everyone's small contributions. One person choosing to introduce something different can shift the temperature more than they expect. You do not have to announce what you are doing. You just do it.	Groups drift. They also redirect. What would you add?	30	situations,group dynamics,positive influence,leadership
Q087	THINK	What I actually want	2	youth	You are about to do something to impress someone in your group. If you are honest with yourself, do you actually want to do this thing or are you doing it purely to be seen?	Asking yourself why you are doing something is a useful habit — acting from genuine choice feels different from acting under social pressure	It does not matter why you do something since the action is the same either way	Doing things to impress people is always wrong and means your motives are not genuine	You should always do what the group expects since belonging is more important than motivation	a	There is nothing wrong with wanting to be seen — that is deeply human. But knowing whether you are acting from genuine desire or social performance helps you stay connected to yourself. Acting constantly from social performance is exhausting. Genuine choice — even when it is the same action — feels different.	Would you do this if no one was watching?	20	think first,identity,choice,authenticity
Q088	EMO	When your face gives it away	2	youth	You are trying to look unbothered but your face is going red and your eyes are getting watery. You are holding it together in public. The most helpful thing to understand is...	Physical emotional responses are involuntary — they are not something you did wrong and most people in that moment feel the same	You have failed at managing your emotions since a calmer person would not show anything	Everyone in the room is focused on your face and drawing conclusions about you	You should have prepared better for the possibility of being in a situation like this	a	Your body's physical response to strong emotion — flushing, trembling, eyes filling — is not under conscious control in the moment. These responses are involuntary, not performances. Almost everyone has experienced them. The most useful thing in that moment is to let the physical response happen while choosing what you do next.	Your body's reaction and your next action are two different things.	20	emotions,physical response,social anxiety,self-compassion
Q089	SIT	The reputation gap	3	youth	Someone has a reputation for being difficult. When you spend time with them one-to-one, they seem quite different — more thoughtful and reasonable than expected. You should...	Hold both pieces of information carefully — what you directly experienced and what others have reported — and let your understanding be richer than either alone	Ignore your direct experience and stick with the group's reputation since more people cannot be wrong	Report back to the group that the reputation is wrong and they should all reconsider	Trust your direct experience completely and dismiss the reputation as jealousy or misunderstanding	a	Reputation and direct experience are both real information but different kinds of information. Reputation is what many people across time have experienced. Direct experience is what you found in that specific moment. Good thinkers hold both and let their understanding be complex rather than choosing one.	What does your direct experience add to what you already knew?	30	situations,judgement,reputation,critical thinking
Q090	THINK	Being the same person	2	youth	You notice that who you are depends a lot on who you are with — louder with some, quieter with others, funnier with some, more serious with others. This is...	Normal social adapting — but worth checking whether any version requires you to be someone you do not recognise or do not like	Fake and dishonest since a genuine person would be consistent in every situation	Evidence that you have no fixed personality and are too easily shaped by others	Something that naturally disappears as you get older and become more settled in yourself	a	Adapting to different social contexts is normal and often appropriate. You speak differently to a teacher than to a best friend — that is social intelligence. The question is whether any of your social versions requires you to act against your own values or be someone you genuinely do not like.	Which version of you do you most recognise as actually you?	20	think first,identity,authenticity,self-awareness
Q091	SIT	Who benefits	3	youth	Something has happened in your group and someone is telling the story in a way that makes them look good and someone else look bad. Before accepting it, it is useful to ask...	Who benefits from you believing this particular version of events?	Why would anyone lie to people they consider friends?	Whether the absent person is really as bad as described in the story	Whether you are being too suspicious of someone who trusts you enough to tell you things	a	Asking who benefits from a version of events is one of the most useful critical thinking tools you can use. It is not the same as assuming someone is lying. It recognises that all storytelling involves choices — what to include, what to leave out — and those choices are usually shaped by self-interest.	Who comes out looking good in this story? Did they tell it?	30	situations,critical thinking,bias,stories
Q092	EMO	Anxiety as a signal	3	youth	You feel very anxious about something coming up. The anxiety is telling you...	Something matters to you and your system is preparing for it — anxiety is a signal, not a prediction of the outcome	That the thing will definitely go badly since anxiety is your brain's forecast	That you are not ready and should avoid the situation until you feel more prepared	That something is wrong with how you handle pressure compared to everyone else	a	Anxiety is often misread as a prediction — I feel anxious therefore something bad will happen. But anxiety is your nervous system preparing you for something that matters. It is energy, not prophecy. Reframing it from I am scared this will go wrong to my system is getting me ready can genuinely change your experience.	Is this a prediction or a preparation?	30	emotions,anxiety,reframing,nervous system
Q093	THINK	Loyalty and truth	3	youth	Your best friend did something that hurt another person and is now asking you to cover for them. You know what actually happened. This is...	A situation where honesty and loyalty are in direct tension — how you handle it reveals something about your character	An easy choice since loyalty to close friends always comes first in situations like this	Only a real dilemma if the person who was hurt finds out and asks you directly	Something you should avoid entirely by not getting involved in other people's conflicts	a	Being asked to lie for someone you care about puts two important values in direct conflict — honesty and loyalty. Agreeing to cover for someone can damage your own integrity and often does not help your friend face the consequences of their actions. Real loyalty sometimes means not making it easier to avoid accountability.	What does real loyalty actually mean here?	30	think first,honesty,loyalty,values
Q094	SIT	The silent treatment	2	youth	Someone who is usually friendly is suddenly not speaking to you. They have not told you why. The most useful first step is...	Ask calmly if everything is okay between you — once and without pressure — then give them space to respond	Panic and mentally review every single thing you could possibly have done wrong	Ignore them back so they know you are not going to chase them	Get other friends to find out what you did so you can fix it faster	a	The silent treatment is difficult because it denies you the information you need to understand what happened. Checking in once, calmly, is fair and direct. Then waiting without escalating gives both of you space. You cannot fix something you do not understand.	Ask once, calmly. Then wait.	20	situations,relationships,conflict,communication
Q095	EMO	Contagious emotions	2	youth	You were fine before you arrived, but after spending time with a very anxious or negative person, you feel noticeably worse. What happened?	You likely absorbed some of their emotional state — emotions are genuinely contagious and our nervous systems respond to the people around us	Nothing meaningful — feelings come entirely from inside you and other people cannot affect them	You were probably already feeling that way and just did not notice it until you sat down	They said something specific that affected you even if you did not consciously register it	a	Human beings are wired to catch emotions from each other. It is called emotional contagion and it is a real neurological process. Spending time with someone in a highly anxious or negative state can genuinely leave you feeling some version of that. Knowing this means you can recognise it and choose your response.	Where did that feeling actually come from?	20	emotions,emotional contagion,awareness,self-protection
Q096	THINK	Not making it worse	1	youth	You are in a situation that is already tense. You feel the urge to say something sharp that will show you are not bothered. Before you say it, ask yourself...	Will saying this actually make this moment better, or am I just performing toughness?	Is what I am about to say funny enough to be worth the risk?	Will this impress the person who seems to be in charge of this situation?	Is what I am about to say literally true and therefore fair to say?	a	Sharp comments in tense moments can feel like armour — they signal I am fine and in control. But they often escalate rather than calm things down. The question worth asking is whether you are serving the moment or just serving your image.	Are you doing this for the room or for yourself?	10	think first,de-escalation,self-awareness,social pressure
Q097	SIT	Reading support	1	youth	You are struggling with something and a friend sits with you, does not say much, but stays close. This kind of support is...	Companionship — sometimes being with someone without advice is the most helpful thing possible	Unhelpful since they should be giving you advice or practical suggestions	Strange behaviour since most people would talk or try to fix the problem	Awkward for both of you even if they mean well by staying	a	Not all support comes in words. Sometimes the most powerful thing another person can do is simply stay. Presence without pressure — being with someone in a quiet moment — is a real and important form of care. Noticing when you need this and when you can offer it is an important skill.	What was their silence actually saying?	10	situations,support,friendship,empathy
Q098	EMO	The reset moment	2	youth	After a really hard emotional experience, certain things help you feel like yourself again — a walk, music, drawing, food, time alone. These are...	Your personal regulation tools — the things your nervous system has learned help it recover	Avoidance tactics that stop you processing what actually happened	Signs you have not yet learned to sit with difficult feelings properly	Childish coping strategies that work now but will need to be replaced later	a	Every person's nervous system has things that help it come back from high states of stress or emotion. Walks, music, creative activities, food, solitude — these are not avoidance, they are recovery. Knowing yours is one of the most practically useful things you can learn about yourself.	What brings you back to yourself?	20	emotions,regulation,recovery,self-knowledge
Q099	SIT	When you do not know where you stand	2	youth	You cannot tell if someone likes you or not — they are warm one day and cold the next, friendly in private and distant in public. This inconsistency is probably...	A reflection of something going on for them rather than a clear signal about how they feel about you	Definitely a sign they do not like you and are too polite to say so directly	Your own anxiety making you misread normal variation in how people behave day to day	Deliberate behaviour designed to keep you slightly unsure so you keep trying	a	Inconsistency is one of the hardest social experiences to navigate because it denies you reliable information. Hot-cold behaviour is usually about something happening for them — managing their own anxiety, navigating group pressure, dealing with something at home — and not a clear verdict on you.	Is their inconsistency really about you?	20	situations,relationships,uncertainty,self-protection
Q100	THINK	The choice to stay yourself	3	youth	You are in a situation where fitting in would require you to be unkind, dishonest or someone you do not recognise. The clearest version of strength is...	Quietly remaining who you are — without making a speech about it and without needing anyone to notice	Fitting in this once since belonging matters and you can be yourself another time	Arguing loudly for your values so everyone in the group knows where you stand	Leaving every situation that puts pressure on who you are	a	The strongest version of yourself is the most consistent one. Staying who you are, without performing it, without needing anyone to notice — in a moment where the pressure is to become something else — that is what genuine character looks like. It does not require an audience. It just requires you.	You do not need to announce your values. You just need to live them.	30	think first,identity,values,character,integrity
