EF-001	Executive Function	Task Initiation	both	1	streak	5	The 2-Minute Launch	You don't have to finish it. You just have to start.	Pick one task you've been avoiding. Set a timer for 2 minutes. Do only that task for 2 minutes — when the timer goes off, you're done (or keep going if you want). The rule is: you ONLY have to do 2 minutes.	You started the task. That's the win. Even 10 seconds counts.	timer	yes	initiation, low-barrier, avoidance, starter
EF-002	Executive Function	Task Initiation	youth	1	streak	5	The Ready-Set-Go	Getting started is the hardest part. Let's trick your brain into it.	Think of one thing you need to do today. Say out loud (or write): "I will do [task] at [time] for [X] minutes." Then at that time, stand up and say "Ready... Set... Go!" before you begin.	You said the words AND started within 60 seconds of your set time.	none	yes	routine, initiation, verbal cue, youth
EF-003	Executive Function	Planning	both	2	goal_setting	15	The 3-Step Shrink	Big tasks feel huge because we see them as one giant blob. Let's shrink it.	Choose one task that feels overwhelming. Break it into exactly 3 smaller steps — no more. Write each step as an action starting with a verb (e.g., "Open the document", "Write the first sentence", "Save and close"). Now do Step 1 only.	You have 3 written action steps and completed Step 1.	notebook or paper	yes	planning, decomposition, overwhelm, goals
EF-004	Executive Function	Planning	adult	2	goal_setting	20	The Weekly Anchor	Having 3 non-negotiables per week beats having 20 forgotten tasks.

You have 3 written anchors for the week, ranked and visible.	notebook, pen	yes	weekly planning, priorities, adult, executive function
EF-005	Executive Function	Prioritisation	adult	2	focus_drill	10	The Triage Sort	Your brain wants to do everything at once. This drill forces a decision.	Write down everything on your mind right now (tasks, worries, ideas) — spend 3 minutes dumping it all out. Then mark each item: A (urgent + important), B (important, not urgent), C (everything else). Circle your one A item. That's your next move.	You have a brain dump list with at least one item categorised and one A item circled.	paper, pen, timer	yes	prioritisation, decision-making, brain dump
EF-006	Executive Function	Prioritisation	youth	1	focus_drill	10	The 3-Pile Sort	When everything feels important, nothing gets done. Let's sort it out.

You sorted your tasks into piles and identified one "do next" task.	sticky notes or paper slips	yes	prioritisation, youth, sorting, visual
EF-007	Executive Function	Organisation	both	2	streak	10	The 10-Minute Reset	Chaos drains energy. Order creates calm — even small order.	Set a timer for 10 minutes. Pick one small space (desk, bag, drawer, shelf). Put things back where they belong. Throw away what's rubbish. Stop when the timer goes off — even if it's not perfect.	You spent 10 minutes on the reset. The space is measurably tidier than before.	timer	yes	organisation, environment, reset, routine
EF-008	Executive Function	Organisation	youth	1	streak	5	The Backpack Scan	A chaotic bag creates a chaotic morning. 5 minutes fixes it.	Empty your school bag completely.

Number them. What's Level 1?	You have a visual map with at least 4 steps drawn and Level 1 identified.	paper, pencil	yes	goal mapping, youth, visual, sequencing
EF-013	Executive Function	Transitions	both	1	streak	5	The Transition Countdown	Switching tasks is hard. A countdown makes the brain feel safe.	When you need to switch from one activity to another, give yourself a 5-minute countdown warning. Say or think: "In 5 minutes I'm switching to [next task]." At 2 minutes, say it again. Then close down what you're doing before starting new.	You used the countdown transition at least once today and switched without a major conflict or meltdown.	timer	yes	transitions, routine, switching, flexibility
EF-014	Executive Function	Transitions	youth	1	streak	5	The Closing Ritual	Finishing one thing properly helps your brain move to the next.

ER-013	Emotional Regulation	Celebration	both	1	streak	5	The Daily Win Log	ADHD brains filter OUT successes and filter IN failures. Reverse the filter.	Every evening, write 3 things that went well today — no matter how small. "I remembered to eat lunch" counts. "I responded to one message" counts. The size of the win doesn't matter. The noticing does.	Three wins written, no matter how small.	notebook, pen	yes	wins, daily, gratitude, positivity, self-esteem
RW-001	Real-World Application	Morning Routine	both	1	streak	15	The Morning Anchor Routine	A good morning shapes a good day. Build one anchor you can always do.	Design a 3-step morning anchor: one thing for your body (e.g., drink water, stretch), one for your mind (e.g., read today's tasks), one for your mood (e.g., music, fresh air). Write it down. Do it for 7 days in a row.	Routine designed and completed for at least 5 out of 7 days.	notebook	yes	morning, routine, daily, anchor
RW-002	Real-World Application	Morning Routine	youth	1	streak	10	The Morning Launchpad	A smooth morning starts the night before AND the morning of.	Create a "Launchpad Checklist" for your morning (e.g., eat breakfast, get dressed, pack bag, check timetable). Put it on your bedroom door. Tick it off each morning. Try for 5 days in a row.	Checklist made and used for at least 3 consecutive mornings.	paper, pen or printed checklist	yes	youth, morning, checklist, routine
RW-003	Real-World Application	Study Skills	youth	2	focus_drill	20	The Active Recall Study Session	Re-reading is passive. This technique actually wires in the learning.	Read a section of your notes or textbook for 5 minutes. Close it. Write everything you can remember. Open it. Check what you missed. Reread missed items. Repeat. This is 3x more effective than just re-reading.	You completed at least 2 active recall rounds on the same material.	textbook or notes, blank paper, timer	yes	studying, youth, active recall, academic
RW-004	Real-World Application	Study Skills	youth	2	focus_drill	15	The Teach-Back Method	If you can explain it, you understand it. Pretend you're the teacher.	After studying a topic, pretend you are explaining it to a younger student. Say it out loud or write it in simple words. Don't look at your notes. When you get stuck, that's what you still need to learn.	You explained the topic without notes for at least 2 minutes and identified at least one gap in your understanding.	notes to study first, no notes during teach-back	yes	youth, study, teaching, comprehension
RW-005	Real-World Application	Work Productivity	adult	2	goal_setting	20	The MIT Method	Most Important Task first — before the day hijacks you.	Before starting work each day, write your 3 Most Important Tasks (MITs). These should take 20-90 minutes each. Do MIT #1 before opening email or any messaging. Block the time in your calendar.	3 MITs written before starting work. MIT #1 started before email was opened.	calendar, notebook	yes	adult, work, productivity, priorities
RW-006	Real-World Application	Work Productivity	adult	2	streak	10	The End-of-Day Handoff	Ending the workday with intention prevents the bleed-over that exhausts ADHD brains.	At the end of each work day, spend 5 minutes: (1) Write what you completed, (2) Write your top 3 MITs for tomorrow, (3) Close all tabs and apps. This creates a clear psychological boundary.	End-of-day routine completed. Tomorrow's 3 MITs are written.	notebook or task app	yes	adult, work, shutdown, routine
RW-007	Real-World Application	Household Management	adult	1	streak	10	The One-Touch Rule	The pile is made of good intentions. One-touch stops the pile.	The rule: whenever you handle an item (mail, a dish, a piece of clothing), deal with it fully right then — put it away, bin it, or file it. Do not put it down to handle later. Practice this for one category of item today (e.g., post/mail only).	You applied the one-touch rule to at least 5 items today.	none	yes	adult, household, clutter, organisation
RW-008	Real-World Application	Social Communication	both	2	streak	10	The Name Anchor	Remembering names shows people they matter. ADHD makes this hard. Here's a fix.	When you meet someone new, say their name back within the first 30 seconds: "Great to meet you, [Name]." Then use it once more in the conversation. Afterwards, write the name with one detail about them.	You used the person's name twice during the conversation and recorded it with a memory hook.	small notebook (optional)	yes	social, names, memory, communication
RW-009	Real-World Application	Financial Skills	adult	2	goal_setting	20	The Money Snapshot	You can't manage what you don't see. This drill creates clarity.	Spend 20 minutes writing down every regular monthly expense you can think of. Categorise: Fixed (rent, bills), Variable (food, transport), Optional (subscriptions, eating out). Total each category. Is this what you expected?	All 3 categories listed with totals. One surprising item identified.	notebook, bank statements if needed	yes	adult, finances, budgeting, clarity
RW-010	Real-World Application	Time Management	both	2	streak	15	The Buffer Builder	ADHD underestimates travel time, prep time, and transition time. Add a buffer.	Look at your schedule for tomorrow. For each commitment, add 15 minutes before it as buffer time. Block this buffer in your calendar or planner. Treat it as sacred — not for squeezing in other tasks.	Tomorrow's schedule has 15-minute buffers before each commitment, blocked in writing.	calendar or planner	yes	time management, buffer, planning, transitions
RW-011	Real-World Application	Relationships	adult	2	reflection	15	The Connection Check-In	ADHD can create distance in relationships without meaning to. This drill closes the gap.	Think of the 3 most important relationships in your life. For each one, ask: When did I last reach out proactively? When did I last really listen? What do they need from me right now? Write one action you'll take for each relationship this week.	3 relationships assessed. One action per relationship written.	notebook, pen	yes	adult, relationships, connection, empathy
RW-012	Real-World Application	Sleep Hygiene	both	1	streak	5	The Sleep Countdown	Sleep is the foundation of ADHD management. Build a wind-down signal.	30 minutes before your planned sleep time: screens off, lights dimmer, no new stimulating content. Do one calm activity (reading fiction, light stretching, drawing, listening to calm music). Track how long it takes to fall asleep each night for 5 nights.	Screens off 30 minutes before bed for at least 4 of 5 nights. Sleep onset time tracked.	sleep log, timer	yes	sleep, routine, wind-down, daily
RW-013	Real-World Application	Goal Achievement	both	2	goal_setting	20	The WOOP Goal Frame	Wishing alone doesn't work. This science-backed method does.	For one goal, write: W = Wish (what you want), O = Outcome (how it will feel when achieved), O = Obstacle (what will most likely get in the way — be honest), P = Plan (if [obstacle] happens, then I will [specific action]). Complete all 4.	All 4 WOOP elements written clearly. The obstacle and plan sections are specific (not vague).	notebook, pen	yes	goals, WOOP, planning, obstacle
RW-014	Real-World Application	Goal Achievement	both	1	goal_setting	15	The Monthly Review	Looking back builds awareness. Looking forward builds direction.	At the end of every month, write answers to: (1) What 3 things went well this month? (2) What one thing didn't go as planned? (3) What did I learn about myself? (4) What's my one focus for next month?	All 4 questions answered. One focus for next month written.	notebook, pen	yes	monthly review, reflection, goals, awareness
RW-015	Real-World Application	Self-Advocacy	adult	3	reflection	20	The ADHD Disclosure Script	Knowing how to explain your ADHD to others is a life skill.	Write a 3-4 sentence personal script that explains your ADHD honestly and practically to a new manager, teacher, or partner. Focus on: what works for you, what you need, and what you bring to the table. Practice saying it aloud.	Script written. Said aloud at least twice with a confident tone.	notebook, pen	yes	adult, self-advocacy, disclosure, communication
TP-001	Technical Planning	Scope Definition	both	1	goal_setting	15	The In/Out List	Before you plan HOW to do a task, you need to know exactly WHAT the task is — and what it isn't.	Take a task you need to do. Draw a line down a page. On the left write IN: everything that IS part of this task. On the right write OUT: everything that is NOT your job, or doesn't need doing to call this task complete. Most people skip this step — and that's why tasks expand endlessly.	You have a written IN and OUT list for one task. The OUT column has at least 2 entries.	notebook, pen	yes	scope, definition, clarity, planning
TP-002	Technical Planning	Defining Done	both	1	goal_setting	10	The Done Line	Tasks feel endless when you don't know what "finished" actually looks like. Fix that first.	Before starting any task, write one sentence that completes this phrase: "This task is done when..." Be specific. Not "when it's tidy" but "when every item has a place and the floor is clear." Not "when the essay is written" but "when the essay is 500 words, spell-checked, and saved."	You wrote a specific, testable "done" statement for one task before starting it.	notebook, pen	yes	done criteria, clarity, goal, planning
TP-003	Technical Planning	Defining Done	youth	1	goal_setting	10	The Finish Line Description	If you don't know what the finish line looks like, how will you know when you've crossed it?	Pick one task (homework, a chore, a project). Write or draw what it will look like when it's truly finished. Be specific — what can you see, check, hand in, or tick off? Now read it back. Does it feel clear? If not, make it sharper.	A specific, visual "finished" description is written or drawn.	paper, pencil	yes	youth, done, visual, clarity
TP-004	Technical Planning	Task Anatomy	both	2	goal_setting	20	The Task Dissection	Every task is actually several smaller tasks wearing a disguise. Expose them.	Choose one task. Ask: "What are ALL the separate actions required to complete this?" Write each action as a verb + object (e.g., "Find the form", "Fill in Section 2", "Attach the receipt", "Email to accounts"). Include the boring prep steps most people forget (finding materials, printing, travel time).	You have a task broken into at least 5 specific verb-led actions, including at least one prep step.	notebook, pen	yes	decomposition, action steps, task anatomy, planning
TP-005	Technical Planning	Task Anatomy	youth	1	goal_setting	15	The Recipe Plan	Every task is like a recipe — it has ingredients, steps, and a finished dish.	Pick a task (like making a poster, writing a story, or tidying a space). Write it out like a recipe: INGREDIENTS (what you need), STEPS (in order — number them), and FINISHED DISH (what it looks like when done). Now look at Step 1. Can you start right now?	Recipe plan written with all 3 sections. Step 1 is clear and immediately actionable.	paper, pen or pencil	yes	youth, recipe, task steps, visual, planning
TP-006	Technical Planning	Dependency Mapping	both	2	goal_setting	15	The "Before This" Chain	Some steps are blocked until other things happen. Finding those blockers early prevents last-minute chaos.	Take your task's action list (or create one now). For each step, ask: "Is there anything that must happen BEFORE this?" Draw an arrow from the blocker to the step it unlocks. Highlight any steps that nothing else can start until they're done — those are your start-first priorities.	You identified at least 2 dependency relationships in your task. One "must start first" step is circled or highlighted.	notebook, pen	yes	dependencies, sequencing, blockers, planning
TP-007	Technical Planning	Dependency Mapping	youth	2	goal_setting	15	The Can't-Do-Yet List	Some steps in a plan are stuck behind other steps. Finding that out early saves a lot of frustration.	Write out the steps of a task or project. For each step, ask: "Can I do this right now, or does something else need to happen first?" Sort them into two columns: CAN DO NOW and STUCK BEHIND (name what's blocking it). Start on the CAN DO NOW list immediately.	Two-column sort completed. At least one blocker is named. CAN DO NOW list has at least 2 items.	paper, pen	yes	youth, dependencies, blockers, sequencing
TP-008	Technical Planning	Resource Mapping	both	1	goal_setting	10	The What-Do-I-Need Scan	Starting a task and then discovering you're missing something halfway through is an ADHD focus-killer.	Before starting a task, ask: "What do I need to complete this?" Write two lists: THINGS (physical materials, tools, files, logins) and PEOPLE (anyone whose input, permission, or help you need). Get everything on those lists in place BEFORE you start.	Both lists written. You have confirmed at least one item is actually available before starting.	notebook, pen	yes	resources, preparation, materials, planning
TP-009	Technical Planning	Resource Mapping	youth	1	goal_setting	10	The Kit Check	Nothing breaks focus faster than realising mid-task that you don't have what you need.	Before you begin any task or activity, do a Kit Check: write down everything you'll need. Then go get each item and place it in front of you. Only start when the kit is assembled. This 3-minute habit saves 15 minutes of broken focus later.	Kit Check list written and all items physically gathered before starting.	paper, pen	yes	youth, preparation, materials, kit, routine
TP-010	Technical Planning	Effort Estimation	both	2	focus_drill	20	The Time Budget	Planning without time estimates is like shopping without money — you'll overspend and run out.	Take your task's action list. For each step, write a realistic time estimate. Add them up. Does the total fit in your available time today? If not, decide: which steps can move to tomorrow? Which can be shortened? Adjust until the plan is realistic.	Every action step has a time estimate. The total is calculated. Plan is adjusted to fit available time.	task list, notebook, pen	yes	time estimation, budgeting, planning, realistic
TP-011	Technical Planning	Effort Estimation	youth	2	focus_drill	15	The Guess-Then-Check	How long will your tasks actually take? Most people have no idea. Here's how to find out.	Before doing your homework or tasks today, write each one down and guess how long it'll take. Then do them and write the actual time. Compare. Were you over or under? Over time, your guesses will get more accurate — and your planning will get much better.	At least 3 tasks estimated and timed. Estimated vs actual recorded and compared.	notebook, pen, timer	yes	youth, time estimation, calibration, homework
TP-012	Technical Planning	Daily Planning	both	1	streak	15	The Daily Blueprint	Five minutes of planning saves an hour of confusion. Build this habit every morning.	Each morning, before anything else, write: (1) The ONE outcome that would make today a success, (2) Three tasks that move toward that outcome, (3) Any fixed commitments (meetings, appointments), (4) One realistic buffer for the unexpected. That's your blueprint. Refer back to it during the day.	Blueprint written with all 4 sections before starting work or school.	notebook, pen or planner app	yes	daily planning, morning, routine, priorities
TP-013	Technical Planning	Daily Planning	youth	1	streak	10	The Today Map	Map out your day before it maps you.	Each morning, draw a simple timeline for your day (you can use boxes or columns). Fill in: things that are fixed (school, meals, lessons), things you need to do (homework, chores), and one thing you want to do. Look at the gaps — that's your free planning time. Is there enough time for everything?	Today Map drawn with fixed, need-to-do, and want-to-do sections filled in.	paper, pencil	yes	youth, daily planning, visual, timeline
TP-014	Technical Planning	Weekly Planning	adult	2	streak	20	The Sunday Blueprint	The week you plan is the week you control. The week you don't plan controls you.	Every Sunday (or your week's start), spend 20 minutes: (1) Review last week — what didn't get done? (2) List all commitments this week, (3) Assign your 3 most important tasks to specific days and times, (4) Identify one likely obstacle and write your response plan for it.	All 4 sections completed. At least 3 tasks are assigned to specific days.	notebook, calendar	yes	adult, weekly planning, review, Sunday
TP-015	Technical Planning	Weekly Planning	youth	1	streak	15	The Week Planner	When you know what's coming, the week feels much less overwhelming.	At the start of each week, write out: (1) What's due this week? (list it all), (2) What day will I do each thing? (assign it), (3) What do I need to prepare in advance? Look at your list each morning and tick things off as you go.	All 3 sections completed. Each due item has an assigned day.	notebook, pen	yes	youth, weekly planning, assignments, routine
TP-016	Technical Planning	Task Batching	adult	2	goal_setting	15	The Batch Cluster	Switching between different types of tasks burns focus. Group similar tasks and do them together.	Look at your task list for this week. Sort all tasks into clusters by type: ADMIN (emails, forms, calls), CREATIVE (writing, designing, making), THINKING (analysis, planning, reading), ERRANDS (physical tasks, going places). Schedule one block per cluster per day rather than mixing them.	Tasks sorted into at least 3 clusters. At least 2 clusters are assigned to specific time blocks.	task list, calendar	yes	adult, batching, efficiency, focus, scheduling
TP-017	Technical Planning	Task Batching	youth	1	goal_setting	10	The Same-Type Stack	Doing similar things together is faster and less exhausting than jumping between totally different activities.	Look at your tasks for today. Group any that feel similar: all reading together, all writing together, all physical stuff together. Do one group at a time. Notice: does it feel easier than switching between totally different things?	Tasks grouped into at least 2 types. One group completed without switching away.	task list, paper	yes	youth, batching, grouping, efficiency
TP-018	Technical Planning	Contingency Planning	both	2	goal_setting	15	The If-Then Shield	Things go wrong. Planning for "wrong" means you don't have to think when it happens.	Take your plan for tomorrow. Ask: "What is the most likely thing that could disrupt this?" Write it down. Now write: "If [disruption] happens, then I will [specific action]." Create 2-3 If-Then pairs. These are your shields. When disruption hits, you already know what to do.	2-3 written If-Then pairs for tomorrow's plan. Each "then" action is specific enough to act on without thinking.	notebook, pen	yes	contingency, if-then, resilience, planning
TP-019	Technical Planning	Contingency Planning	youth	1	goal_setting	10	The Plan B Pocket	Every good plan has a backup. What's yours?	Think of one task or plan you have this week. Ask: "What could go wrong?" Pick the most likely problem. Now write your Plan B — what will you do if that problem happens? Keep it simple. One problem, one backup.	One likely problem identified and one specific Plan B written.	notebook, pen	yes	youth, plan b, backup, contingency
TP-020	Technical Planning	Review & Adjustment	both	2	reflection	10	The End-of-Task Debrief	Every completed task is a free lesson in how you work. Most people skip this lesson.	Immediately after finishing any significant task, spend 5 minutes answering: (1) What part of my plan worked well? (2) What slowed me down or went differently than expected? (3) What would I do differently next time? Keep these in a running "lessons" document.	All 3 debrief questions answered in writing. Notes added to a running lessons document.	notebook or digital notes	yes	review, debrief, reflection, improvement
TP-021	Technical Planning	Review & Adjustment	youth	1	reflection	10	The How Did That Go? Check	Finishing a task is great. Understanding HOW you did it makes you better next time.	After finishing a piece of homework, a chore, or a project, answer these 3 questions: (1) Did I stick to my plan? (2) What took longer than I expected? (3) What would make it easier next time? Write the answers — even one sentence each.	3 questions answered. At least one specific insight written about what to do differently.	notebook, pen	yes	youth, review, reflection, improvement
