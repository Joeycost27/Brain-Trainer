What are people's eyes and body showing you?	20	situations,body language,social signals,attention
Q011	SIT	Timing	2	youth	You have brilliant news to share. But your teacher looks very busy and stressed right now. What should you do?

Start on Thursday evening — you will remember it by then	Break it into small steps and work on one step each day	Do the whole thing in one go tonight	Ask a friend to help you last minute on Friday morning	b	Spreading work across several days means each piece feels small and manageable.

What could you do on each one?	10	tasks,planning,time management,homework
Q019	TASK	Staying on task	2	youth	You are halfway through tidying your room when you spot your favourite book. You REALLY want to read it. What should you do?	Read just one chapter — then carry on tidying	Leave the book and keep tidying until the job is done	Stop tidying — reading is more important	Hide the book so you are not tempted	b	This is a focus test! The job is not done yet — and one chapter almost always turns into more. Finishing the task first means you can enjoy the book in real free time. You will enjoy it even more when it is truly earned.	Finish what you started — then enjoy the reward.	20	tasks,focus,staying on task,distraction

What is the logical order — what do you need to know before you can do each step?	10	tasks,organisation,packing,systems
Q021	TASK	Time estimation	2	youth	You planned to finish your homework in 20 minutes but it took 45 minutes. What should you do NEXT time?	Give up estimating — it clearly does not work	Add extra time when you plan — tasks almost always take longer than we think	Rush next time so it fits in 20 minutes	Just start later so it does not matter	b	Nearly everyone underestimates how long things take — even adults! The trick is to learn from experience and add a buffer of extra time. Good planners know that a 20-minute task often needs 35–40 minutes in reality.	What could you change about your time estimate next time?	20	tasks,time management,estimation,planning
Q022	TASK	Priority under time pressure	3	youth	You have 15 minutes before school and three things to do: eat breakfast, find your PE kit and brush your teeth. What is the BEST order?	PE kit first since finding it might take the longest, then breakfast, then teeth	Teeth first, then PE kit, then breakfast	Breakfast first since you are hungry, then teeth, then PE kit	It does not matter — just do them in any order	a	When time is tight, do the most uncertain task first. Finding a PE kit could take 1 minute or 10 — you do not know. Do that first while you have the most time. Then the rest is predictable and easy. This is real planning thinking!	Which task is least predictable? Do that one first.	30	tasks,planning,priority,time pressure
Q023	GOAL	Persistence	1	youth	You want to learn to ride a bike but you keep falling off. What should you do?	Give up — maybe you are just not a bike person	Keep practising a little each day — falling off is how you learn	Only try when you feel completely ready	Watch videos instead of practising	b	Every skill — riding a bike, reading, drawing, sport — is learned by trying, failing and trying again. Every fall is your brain and body gathering information. Progress happens through practice, not by waiting until you feel ready.	What does every expert have in common with every beginner?	10	goals,persistence,growth mindset,learning
Q024	GOAL	Bouncing back	2	youth	You set a goal to read one chapter every night. After three good nights you miss one. What should you do?	Give up on the goal — you already failed	Start a completely new goal instead	Pick up where you left off — one missed night does not end a goal	Read five chapters the next night to catch up	c	Missing one day does not mean you have failed a goal. Goals are about patterns over time, not perfect streaks. The most important thing is to keep going after a setback — that is what separates people who achieve things from those who do not.	What matters more — one missed day or the whole pattern over time?	20	goals,resilience,setbacks,persistence
Q025	GOAL	SMART goals	2	youth	A good goal is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-based. Which of these is the BEST goal?	I want to get better at Maths	I will practise my times tables for ten minutes every day this week	I will be the best at everything at school	I might try to do some reading sometimes	b	Practising times tables for 10 minutes every day this week is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-based.

Introduce yourself to ten people at once	Wait for someone to come to you	Smile and say hello to one person who seems friendly	Tell everyone about yourself so they get to know you	c	Big goals start with tiny actions. A smile and hello is low risk and high reward. You do not have to do everything at once — one small step is always the right place to start, and it leads naturally to the next one.	What is the smallest possible first step you could take?	10	goals,small steps,friendship,action
Q027	GOAL	Confidence and action	2	youth	You want to audition for the school play but you have never done it before and feel nervous. What is the most helpful thing to tell yourself?	I will probably fail so I should not bother	I cannot try until I feel completely confident	Being nervous is normal — I will try anyway and see what happens	Everyone will laugh at me	c	Waiting until you feel 100% confident before trying something new means you will never try anything.

Does confidence come before action, or does it grow from taking action?	20	goals,confidence,courage,trying new things
Q028	MAN	Patience in public	1	youth	You are at a restaurant with your family. The food is taking a long time and you are really hungry. What is the polite thing to do?	Complain loudly so the waiter hurries up	Wait patiently and find something to talk about while you wait	Ask every few minutes when the food will arrive	Say you want to leave	b	Patience in public is a real and important skill.

How would the people around you feel with each of these choices?	10	manners,patience,public behaviour,restaurants
Q029	MAN	Saying thank you	1	youth	Someone holds a door open for you. What should you say?	Nothing — they chose to do it	Finally!	Thank you!	You did not have to do that	c	Saying thank you when someone does something kind — even something small like holding a door — is one of the most important habits you can build. It makes the other person feel appreciated and it makes you someone others enjoy being around.	Two little words that mean everything.	10	manners,thank you,gratitude,politeness
Q030	MAN	Receiving hospitality	1	youth	You are eating dinner at a friend's house and you do not like the food. What is the polite thing to do?	Tell them honestly it is disgusting — honesty is best	Eat a little of what you can and say thank you for dinner	Secretly feed it to the family pet	Ask for something different to eat instead	b	Someone made that meal for you and put thought into it. Eating a little and saying thank you honours the effort they made. It is only one meal — and kindness to a host is more important than your food preference in that moment.	Think about how much effort went into preparing that meal.	10	manners,hospitality,guests,gratitude
Q031	MAN	Accidents	1	youth	You accidentally bump into someone and knock their things over. What should you do?	Keep walking — it was an accident so it does not count	Say sorry quickly and help pick things up	Blame them for being in the way	Look away and hope they did not notice	b	Accidents happen to everyone.

What would you want someone to do if they bumped into you?	10	manners,apologies,accidents,character
Q032	MAN	Listening properly	2	youth	You are in a conversation and you really want to say something. The other person has not finished speaking yet. What should you do?	Jump in — your point is important	Wait for a natural pause, then share your thought	Interrupt politely with sorry to interrupt but	Forget your point — it probably was not that important	b	Interrupting — even politely — cuts off the other person before they have finished their thought. Waiting for a natural pause shows you are genuinely listening and not just waiting for your turn to talk. This makes conversations much better for everyone.	Are you actually listening, or just waiting to speak?	20	manners,listening,interrupting,conversations
Q033	MAN	Helping strangers	1	youth	A younger child at school is sitting alone and crying. You do not know them. What is the kind thing to do?	Walk past — it is none of your business	Stare at them	Go over calmly and ask if they are okay, or find an adult to help	Tell your friends about it	c	Kindness to people we do not know — especially younger or more upset people — is one of the most important kinds of manners there is. You do not have to solve anything. Noticing and doing something small can mean everything to someone having a hard time.	What would you hope someone would do if that was you sitting there?	10	manners,kindness,helping strangers,empathy
Q034	MAN	Receiving gifts	1	youth	You receive a birthday present that you do not like at all. What is the polite response?	Is there a receipt? I want to exchange it	Oh. This is not really what I wanted	Thank you so much — that is really kind of you!	Put it straight down and say nothing	c	The person who gave you that gift chose it for you and made the effort to bring it.

Think about the giver, not just the gift.	10	manners,gifts,gratitude,social skills
Q035	MAN	Public spaces	2	youth	You are in the cinema and something very funny happens. You laugh loudly for a very long time. People around you start looking over. What should you do?

Cinemas, libraries, theatres and cafes are shared experiences. Being aware of how much space your sounds and actions take up is a key part of being someone others enjoy being around in public.	Whose experience is affected by how loud you are right now?	20	manners,public spaces,awareness,consideration
Q036	CARE	Listening to your body	1	youth	You have been on a screen for three hours. Your eyes feel tired and your neck aches. What should you do?	Keep going — you are in the middle of something	Take a break — go outside, drink some water and rest your eyes	Switch to watching TV instead — that is a different screen	Have a snack and carry on	b	Your body sends clear signals when it needs a break. Tired eyes and an aching neck are messages! Stepping away from screens, moving around and drinking water resets both your brain and your body. These signals are worth listening to.	What is your body trying to tell you right now?	10	self-care,screen time,body signals,breaks

Skip breakfast to get more sleep	Eat a proper breakfast, drink some water and get some fresh air if possible	Check your phone as soon as you wake up	Stay in bed as long as possible	b	Your brain runs on fuel — food and water.

Go straight onto screens to distract yourself	Do your homework immediately while it is fresh	Have a snack and a few quiet minutes before deciding what to do	Tell everyone about your difficult day immediately	c	After a hard day your brain and body need time to recover before you make decisions about what to do next.

What does your body need right after a really demanding day?	20	self-care,recovery,decompression,emotional regulation
Q039	CARE	Sleep hygiene	2	youth	You need to sleep but you are looking at your phone and you are not tired. The BEST thing to do is...	Keep going until you feel tired naturally	Put the phone in another room 30 minutes before sleep and do something calm instead	Turn the brightness down so it is less harmful	Watch TV instead since that is a bigger screen not a small one	b	Phone screens produce blue light that tells your brain to stay awake — even when you want to sleep.

What is the screen doing to your brain's sleep signals right now?	20	self-care,sleep,screen time,habits
Q040	CARE	Managing worries	2	youth	You feel anxious about something happening tomorrow and cannot stop thinking about it. What is a helpful thing to do tonight?	Lie awake going over everything that could go wrong	Write down your worries and then put the paper away — your brain can rest once it knows they are recorded	Stay up late to distract yourself	Pretend you are not worried	b	Writing worries down is proven to reduce anxiety. It works because you move the worry from your head onto paper — which tells your brain the thought is safe and will not be forgotten. Once written, your brain is much more willing to let go of it and rest.	What happens when you keep a worry going round and round inside your head?	20	self-care,anxiety,worry,sleep
Q041	THINK	Pause before reacting	1	youth	You are playing a board game and your friend makes a move that does not feel fair. Your first reaction is to flip the board. What should you do INSTEAD?	Flip the board — they deserve it	Take a breath, pause for three seconds, then calmly say it does not feel fair	Ignore it and let them keep cheating	Cry	b	The pause between feeling something and doing something is where your best choices live. Three seconds is enough to stop a reaction you would later regret. Saying how you feel calmly is far more powerful — and far more effective — than flipping a board!	What happens if you count to three before you do anything?	10	think first,impulse control,pause,reactions
Q042	THINK	Responding vs reacting	2	youth	Someone says something mean about you in front of a group of friends. You feel furious. What is the BEST immediate action?	Say something mean straight back	Remove yourself from the situation, take a few breaths, then decide how to respond	Tell the whole school what they did	Cry in front of everyone	b	Reacting immediately when you are furious almost always makes things worse. Removing yourself — even for two minutes — lets your brain's thinking part come back online. Then you can choose how to respond instead of just reacting.	What is the difference between reacting and responding?	20	think first,impulse control,anger,response
Q043	THINK	Checking before taking	1	youth	You are hungry and you see a biscuit left out on the kitchen counter. You are not sure if it belongs to anyone. What should you do?	Eat it — if it is just sitting there it is fair game	Ask first before taking it	Eat half and leave half	Take it quickly and say nothing about it	b	When you are not sure if something belongs to someone, asking takes five seconds and avoids a problem.

What is the cost of not asking?	10	think first,honesty,checking,trust
Q044	THINK	Letting people finish	2	youth	You are listening to a friend talk and they say something that reminds you of your own story. You want to change the subject immediately. You should...	Change the subject — your story is relevant	Let them finish their thought, then share your story	Interrupt with oh that reminds me...	Forget your story since it does not really matter	b	Letting someone finish their thought before you redirect the conversation shows real respect. It tells them: what you are saying matters to me. This single habit makes you a noticeably better friend and conversation partner.	Finish their thought first — then share yours.	20	think first,listening,impulse control,conversations
Q045	THINK	Handling mistakes	1	youth	You get a question wrong in class and feel embarrassed and frustrated. You want to say something rude. What should you do?	Say the rude thing quietly under your breath	Take a breath and remind yourself that getting things wrong is how you learn	Put your hand up and argue that you were actually right	Refuse to answer any more questions today	b	Getting things wrong is not a disaster — it is information.

What do mistakes actually do to your brain?	10	think first,resilience,mistakes,learning
Q046	THINK	Queue jumping	2	youth	You are waiting in a long queue and someone pushes in front of you. You feel a wave of anger rising. Before doing anything, you should...	Push them back	Shout at them to go to the back of the queue	Take a slow breath and decide calmly whether or how to say something	Walk away from the queue entirely	c	The queue-jumper might not have noticed, might be rushing for a reason, or might just be thoughtless. A slow breath gives you the space to choose your response — and a calm response is almost always more effective than an angry one.	Choose your response. Do not just react.	20	think first,anger,queues,calmness
Q047	THINK	In a minute	2	youth	Your mum asks you to help with the washing up. You are in the middle of a game. Your first instinct is to say in a minute and keep playing. What ACTUALLY tends to happen?	You finish the game and help straight away	In a minute often becomes much longer, the task gets forgotten, and someone ends up frustrated	Your mum does it herself without minding	You finish the game with no consequences	b	In a minute is one of the most common forms of delay. When we are doing something enjoyable our brain does not want to stop — and a minute stretches. Getting up and helping immediately actually takes less than five minutes and avoids a conflict that would take much longer to recover from.	How long does in a minute usually actually last?	20	think first,delay,helping,family
Q048	THINK	Angry messages	3	youth	You are about to send a very angry text message to a friend after an argument. What should you do FIRST?	Send it immediately — they need to know how you feel right now	Write it out but wait ten minutes before deciding whether to send it	Get someone else to send it for you	Make the message longer and more detailed to make sure they understand	b	The ten-minute rule for messages is one of the most useful tools there is. In ten minutes your feelings often reduce and you might change the message — or decide not to send it at all. Words sent in anger can cause lasting damage that takes much longer than ten minutes to repair.	Will you feel exactly the same way in ten minutes?	30	think first,anger,messages,consequences
Q049	FOCUS	Managing distraction	2	youth	You need to do your homework but your phone keeps buzzing with messages. The BEST thing to do is...	Check every message as it arrives and then refocus	Put your phone face down in another room until your homework is done	Turn the volume down but keep it next to you	Check messages for a short break every five minutes	b	Every notification breaks your concentration — and research shows it takes several minutes to fully refocus after an interruption. Putting the phone out of reach removes the temptation completely. Short focused bursts beat long distracted sessions every time.	What happens to your focus every time you check a message?	20	focus,distraction,phones,homework
Q050	FOCUS	Mind wandering	1	youth	You have been trying to read for ten minutes and your mind keeps wandering to other things. The BEST response is...	Give up — you cannot focus today	Notice that your mind wandered, gently bring it back to the page, and try again	Read faster so it is over sooner	Read the same sentence over and over until it sticks	b	Mind wandering while reading is completely normal — every human mind wanders. The skill is NOTICING when it has happened and bringing yourself gently back. Every single time you do that, you are practising and strengthening your focus. The wandering is not the failure — giving up would be.	What should you do the moment you notice your mind has drifted?	10	focus,mind wandering,reading,attention
Q051	SIT	Reading dominance	2	youth	You walk into a room and one person is doing most of the talking, others keep glancing at them before they speak, and someone who started to say something stopped when that person looked over. What is happening in this room?	Everyone is just being polite and taking turns	One person has a lot of social power in this group right now — the others are following their lead	The quiet people are just shy	Everyone is waiting for you to arrive	b	When one person holds a lot of social power in a group, you can see it before anyone says anything. Others check their reactions, pause mid-sentence, look for permission. Noticing this is not paranoia — it is reading the room. The first step to navigating a situation is understanding it clearly.	Watch the quiet people more than the loud one.	20	situations,group dynamics,social power,reading the room
Q052	SIT	Recognising pressure	1	youth	Your friend group has decided something and everyone agrees — except you. You do not agree, but everyone turns and looks at you expecting you to say yes too. The pressure you feel in that moment is...	Proof that you should agree since everyone else cannot be wrong	Your body warning you that your opinion is about to be ignored — and that you have a choice to make	A sign you are too sensitive	Nothing important	b	That pressure feeling — the almost physical weight of everyone's expectation — is your body's signal that something matters here. Your opinion is real. You do not have to agree just because everyone turned to look at you. Noticing the pressure is the first step to choosing your response rather than just reacting.	Your body felt it before your brain named it. What was it telling you?	10	situations,peer pressure,group dynamics,identity
Q053	SIT	The loudest voice	2	youth	In a group project, one person immediately starts telling everyone what to do. They have not asked what anyone else thinks. Two people start following their instructions. You have a different idea. What is the best way to handle this?	Stay quiet — they seem confident and they are probably right	Argue loudly that your idea is better	Say clearly but calmly: before we start, can we hear everyone's ideas quickly?	Do things your own way silently	c	The loudest person in a group is not automatically the person with the best idea. Asking to hear everyone's ideas before diving in is not a challenge — it is good leadership. It is also one of the most effective ways to contribute without getting into a confrontation.	You do not have to fight the loud voice. You can redirect the room.	20	situations,group dynamics,assertiveness,leadership
Q054	SIT	When the room goes quiet	2	youth	A teacher asks who made a mess. The whole class goes silent and everyone looks at the floor. You did not do it — but you notice the actual person shifting in their seat and avoiding eye contact. What does their body language tell you?	Nothing — everyone looks uncomfortable in trouble	Their body is showing guilt even though they said nothing — physical signals often give away what someone is not saying	They are cold	They are about to be sick	b	Bodies speak before mouths do. Shifting, avoiding eye contact, suddenly very still or fidgety — these are signals that someone is uncomfortable in a specific way. You do not need to act on this observation, but noticing it is a real skill. Reading body language helps you understand what is actually happening in a room.	What is their body doing that words are not saying?	20	situations,body language,reading signals,awareness
Q055	EMO	Freeze response	2	youth	A teacher calls on you unexpectedly. Your mind goes completely blank even though you knew the answer a moment ago. Your face goes hot and you cannot speak. This is called...	Being stupid	Being unprepared	A freeze response — your brain has briefly gone into survival mode because of the sudden pressure	Being lazy	c	When something feels threatening — even something small like being put on the spot — your brain can briefly switch from thinking mode to survival mode. This is called a freeze response and it happens to almost everyone. It does not mean you do not know the answer. It means your brain needed a moment to feel safe again.	This is your brain protecting you — not failing you.	20	emotions,freeze response,anxiety,brain science
Q056	EMO	Body signals as data	1	youth	You are about to do something and your stomach feels tight, your breathing gets shallow and you feel like you want to leave. What is happening?	Your body is telling you something feels wrong or unsafe — that feeling is information worth paying attention to	You probably ate something bad	You are just being dramatic	You are tired	a	Your body runs a faster security check than your thinking brain does. That tight stomach and shallow breathing is your nervous system saying: wait, something about this situation needs more attention. It is not always right — sometimes it is just nerves — but it is always worth noticing.	Your body knows things before your brain catches up. What is it noticing?	10	emotions,body signals,intuition,safety
Q057	EMO	Shrinking feeling	2	youth	A confident older student makes a comment about you in front of a group. You feel yourself wanting to get smaller, look away and disappear. This feeling of wanting to shrink is...	A sign you should agree with what they said	A completely normal response to social threat — and it does not mean what they said is true	A sign you are weak	What everyone else in the room is thinking too	b	The urge to shrink when someone says something critical or embarrassing is your nervous system responding to social threat the same way it would respond to a physical one. It is automatic and very human. But the shrinking feeling is not a verdict on whether what was said was true. Those are two completely separate things.	The urge to shrink is automatic. Choosing what to do next is yours.	20	emotions,social threat,confidence,self-worth
Q058	EMO	Disproportionate reaction	3	youth	Something small happens — a classmate takes the last seat you were heading for — and you feel a huge wave of anger, out of proportion to the situation. What is this most likely a sign of?	You are a bad person	That small thing probably triggered a bigger feeling that was already there — sometimes reactions are bigger than the current moment because they carry older feelings	You hate that person	You need food	b	Big reactions to small triggers are almost always a sign that something older is underneath. The seat was not really the problem — the seat touched something bigger. This is one of the most important things to understand about emotional reactions: the present moment is not always the actual cause.	The feeling was bigger than the moment. What else might have been in it?	30	emotions,triggers,disproportionate reactions,self-awareness
Q059	THINK	Holding your ground	2	youth	A dominant kid in class dismisses your idea in front of everyone by laughing. You know your idea is actually good. The strongest response is...	Immediately take your idea back and pretend you never said it	Say: I still think it is worth thinking about, then let it sit	Shout that they are wrong	Go quiet for the rest of the lesson	b	Staying calm and simply standing by your idea — without escalating and without collapsing — is one of the most powerful things you can do in a group. You are not arguing. You are not backing down. You are just still there. That quiet persistence is harder for a dominant personality to dismiss than a shouting match.	You do not need to fight to stay standing.	20	think first,assertiveness,resilience,social confidence
Q060	THINK	The follower pull	2	youth	You have your own opinion but everyone around you is nodding along to something you disagree with. You feel the pull to nod too just to fit in. Before you nod, you should ask yourself...	Does everyone else nodding make their opinion more correct?	Am I too different to belong here?	Should I just leave?	Would it be easier to nod?	a	Numbers are not the same as truth. A hundred people agreeing with something that is wrong does not make it right. The pull to nod and fit in is very human and very strong — but the question worth asking is whether you are changing your view because of evidence or because of social pressure. Those are completely different reasons.	Are you changing your mind or just changing your expression?	20	think first,peer pressure,critical thinking,identity
Q061	SIT	Who controls the mood	3	youth	You notice that when one particular person in your group is happy, everyone relaxes. When they are in a bad mood, everyone walks on eggshells. What does this pattern tell you?	This is just how groups work	One person has an unusually large amount of emotional control over the group — and that is worth noticing	The group is well-organised	Everyone is just empathetic	b	When one person's mood sets the emotional temperature for a whole group, that is a significant amount of power — and often a significant amount of pressure on everyone else. Noticing this pattern is the beginning of deciding whether to follow that temperature or to set your own.	Who sets the weather in your group?	30	situations,group dynamics,emotional control,awareness
Q062	SIT	Testing behaviour	2	youth	Someone in your group makes a comment that seems like a joke but it is aimed directly at you. Everyone laughs. Then they watch to see how you react. What is probably happening?	They are being friendly	They are testing how you respond to being targeted — your reaction will tell them a lot about how to treat you going forward	They are just funny	It is nothing	b	Some dominant behaviour comes in the form of jokes. The joke is the test — how do you react? If you laugh along and shrink, it signals one thing. If you react calmly without performing upset, it signals another. Your response in that moment teaches people how to treat you. This is not about being hard — it is about not being easy to destabilise.	What are they watching for?	20	situations,testing behaviour,group dynamics,resilience
Q063	SIT	The quiet ally	2	youth	You notice that one person in your group always agrees with the dominant person, even when they clearly do not believe what they are saying. This person is most likely...	Telling the truth	Managing their safety in the group by staying on the dominant person's good side	Being honest	Very confident	b	Keeping yourself safe in a group sometimes means performing agreement even when you disagree. This is not weakness — it is often a very rational response to feeling unsafe. Understanding why people go along with things helps you see the whole picture of what is happening in a group, not just the surface.	What is that person protecting by agreeing?	20	situations,group dynamics,social safety,empathy
Q064	EMO	Anxiety vs. excitement	2	youth	You are about to do something important. Your heart is beating fast, your stomach feels nervous and you have lots of energy. You cannot tell if you are excited or anxious. This is because...	Something is physically wrong	Anxiety and excitement feel almost identical in the body — the difference is mostly in how you interpret the feeling	You are unwell	You are definitely anxious	b	Anxiety and excitement produce almost the same physical response — fast heart rate, adrenaline, heightened attention. The difference is the story you put on top of it. Telling yourself I am excited rather than I am anxious has been shown to genuinely improve performance. Your body cannot always tell the difference. Sometimes your words can choose for it.	What if this fast heart rate was energy, not fear?	20	emotions,anxiety,excitement,reframing
Q065	EMO	Safe person recognition	1	youth	When you walk into a room, you feel more relaxed near some people and more tense near others — without knowing exactly why. This is...	Random and meaningless	Your nervous system doing a rapid safety check based on past experience — it is trying to protect you	Just your imagination	Being dramatic	b	Your nervous system builds a database of experience — who has been kind, who has been unpredictable, who has been safe. It checks new situations against this database automatically and very quickly. That relaxed or tense feeling near certain people is not random. It is your system telling you what it has learned.	Your nervous system did that check before your thinking brain did.	10	emotions,safety,nervous system,intuition
Q066	THINK	Not taking the bait	3	youth	Someone says something provocative to you in front of a group — clearly trying to get a reaction. They want you to argue back so you look emotional and they look in control. The most powerful thing you can do is...	Argue back forcefully so people see you stand up for yourself	React emotionally to show how much it hurt	Stay calm, acknowledge what they said briefly, and move on — giving a non-reaction is the response they cannot use against you	Walk away without saying anything at all	c	Provocation is designed to produce a reaction that makes the provoked person look bad and the provoker look in control. Not taking the bait does not mean you agree with them or that you are weak — it means you understood the game and chose not to play it. Calm acknowledgement and moving on is a skill most adults never master.	What does not reacting take away from them?	30	think first,provocation,self-control,group dynamics
Q067	THINK	Borrowed confidence	2	youth	You notice that a kid who dominates your group only does it when their friends are around. Alone, they are noticeably quieter and more unsure. This tells you...	They have two different personalities	Their confidence is partly borrowed from the group — which means it is not as solid as it looks when it is just you and them	They are faking everything	They are two-faced	b	A lot of dominant or intimidating behaviour in groups is performed for the audience. The same person in a one-to-one situation is often quite different — more uncertain, more human. Understanding this does not mean you trust them automatically. It means their dominance is less about them being powerful and more about the group setting that performance up.	Who are they performing for?	20	think first,understanding others,group dynamics,confidence
Q068	SIT	Reading exclusion	2	youth	You walk up to a group of your classmates and the conversation changes slightly — topic shifts, people glance at each other, someone moves to close the circle a little. What is probably happening?	Nothing — you are being paranoid	The group is likely managing something they do not want you to hear or be part of right now	They all suddenly thought of the same new topic	They did not notice you	b	Exclusion is often silent — a shift in body language, a closed circle, a change of topic. Noticing these signals is not paranoia. It is information. What you do with that information is up to you — you might choose to move on, to address it calmly, or to simply note it and decide later. But not noticing it leaves you walking into situations without the full picture.	What changed the moment you arrived?	20	situations,exclusion,reading signals,self-protection
Q069	SIT	Fair witness	3	youth	Someone tells you something bad about a person who is not there to speak for themselves. You feel yourself immediately believing it. Before you fully believe it, the fairest thing to do is...	Tell everyone what you just heard	Believe it because the person telling you is your friend	Recognise that you are only hearing one side, and hold the judgement loosely until you have more information	Confront the person being talked about immediately	c	A fair witness is someone who waits for enough information before deciding. When someone tells you something about another person, they are presenting one version of reality — filtered through their feelings, their history and their reasons for telling you. This does not mean they are lying. It means you only have one piece of a bigger picture. Hold it that way.	You only heard one side. What might the other side include?	30	situations,fairness,gossip,critical thinking,judgement
Q070	EMO	Feeling flat after conflict	2	youth	After an argument with a friend, you feel flat, exhausted and a bit empty — even though you might have won the argument. This feeling is...	Strange and something to worry about	A normal emotional come-down — conflict uses a lot of energy and the body needs to recover	Proof that you should have lost the argument	Meaning you still feel guilty	b	Conflict activates your stress response — adrenaline, heightened alertness, fast thinking. When it ends, those stress chemicals gradually reduce and your body can feel flat or drained as a result. This is normal biology, not a sign something is wrong. It is also why rest after a difficult social situation is genuinely helpful.	Your body just ran a lot of emotional energy. Of course it needs to recover.	20	emotions,conflict,recovery,body signals
Q071	THINK	Standing still	2	youth	The dominant person in your group is trying to get everyone on one side of an argument. You have not decided what you think yet. The best response is...	Pick a side quickly so you are not left out	Tell them you have not decided yet and you want to think about it	Pretend to agree so there is no pressure	Leave the group	b	Not having formed an opinion yet is a completely valid position. Saying I have not decided, I want to think about it is honest, confident and refuses to be rushed. Groups sometimes create urgency around choosing sides that does not actually exist. You are allowed to take time.	Not deciding yet is different from not caring.	20	think first,independence,peer pressure,critical thinking
Q072	SIT	The group norm check	2	youth	Your friend group has an unspoken rule that everyone makes fun of a certain type of thing. You never really agreed to this but you joined in because everyone else did. This pattern is called...	Fitting in, which is fine	A group norm — an unwritten rule the group enforces without ever officially deciding on it	Being kind	Good teamwork	b	Group norms are invisible rules that form gradually without anyone deciding on them. They can be positive — always supporting each other — or negative — always mocking a certain thing. The important thing is noticing them. Once you name a group norm you are part of, you can decide if it is actually one you would choose.	Did you ever actually agree to this rule?	20	situations,group norms,social behaviour,identity
Q073	EMO	Feeling responsible for others' moods	2	youth	When someone close to you is in a bad mood, you feel anxious and try to fix it or cheer them up even if you did not cause it. This is...	Your responsibility because you care about them	A learned response — you have probably learned that someone's bad mood could affect you, so you try to manage it in advance	Simply being kind	A sign you are too sensitive	b	When we grow up around unpredictable moods, our nervous system can learn to scan for emotional temperature and get to work managing it before anything happens. This is a very useful survival tool — and it can also be exhausting and unfair to yourself. Noticing this pattern is the first step to choosing when to step in and when to leave other people's moods as theirs to manage.	Whose mood is it? Whose job is it?	20	emotions,responsibility,patterns,emotional safety
Q074	THINK	The compliment that feels wrong	2	youth	Someone gives you a compliment and instead of feeling good, something about it makes you feel slightly uncomfortable — like there is something else behind it. You should...	Ignore the feeling since a compliment is a compliment	Notice the discomfort as information — sometimes compliments are used to soften someone up or create a sense of obligation	Thank them and immediately do whatever they are about to ask	Tell them their compliment was suspicious	b	Compliments can be genuine — and they can also be social tools used to create goodwill before making a request, or to make someone feel selected and obligated. Your gut response to a compliment that felt slightly off is worth listening to. It does not mean the compliment was definitely manipulative. It means pay attention to what comes next.	Notice the feeling. Then watch what comes after the compliment.	20	think first,manipulation,social awareness,intuition
Q075	SIT	When silence means something	2	youth	You say something honest in a group and instead of a response, there is a pause and a few people exchange glances. This silence most likely means...	Everyone is thinking carefully about what you said	Something in what you said has landed differently to how you expected — either it surprised people or it touched something uncomfortable	You should never speak in groups	Everyone agrees with you	b	Silence and glances after you speak are information. They are not always negative — but they tell you something unexpected happened. Maybe you said something that surprised people, or contradicted an unspoken group belief, or named something people were avoiding. Sitting with that moment rather than immediately trying to undo what you said is a skill.	What might your words have touched that was already there?	20	situations,silence,reading the room,group dynamics
Q076	THINK	The strong inner voice	3	youth	You are in a difficult social situation and everyone is looking at you to react. You feel confused and pressured. Before you do anything, the most useful thing to access is...	What the group expects you to do	What the dominant person wants from you	A quiet, clear sense of what you actually think and feel, separate from the noise of the moment	The funniest possible response	c	The strong inner voice is not the loudest or most confident-sounding voice. It is the one underneath the noise — the one that knows what you actually think and feel when you stop performing. Getting to that voice, especially under social pressure, is one of the most important skills there is. It takes practice. But it is always there.	Underneath the pressure and the noise — what do you actually think?	30	think first,identity,self-awareness,confidence
Q077	EMO	Feeling out of place	1	youth	You are in a group and you feel like you do not quite fit — like everyone else understands something you do not. This feeling is...	Proof that you do not belong	Almost universal — most people in almost every group feel this way sometimes, even the ones who look most at ease	A sign you should leave and find different friends	Only felt by people who are different	b	The feeling of not quite belonging in a group is one of the most common human feelings there is. The people around you who look most comfortable are almost certainly also managing their own version of this. It does not mean you are wrong for the group. It often means the group has not yet done enough work to make everyone feel genuinely included.	If you could see inside the other people's heads right now, what might you find?	10	emotions,belonging,social anxiety,universality
Q078	SIT	Name what you see	3	youth	A dominant classmate keeps interrupting you every time you speak, but does not interrupt others. You have noticed this pattern over several days. The most useful first step is...	Ignore it — bringing it up will make things worse	Tell everyone in the group what is happening	Name it to yourself precisely first: they interrupt me specifically, not others — that is a pattern, not an accident	Interrupt them back as often as possible	c	Before you can respond to a pattern, you need to name it clearly to yourself. Not they are horrible, which is a feeling — but they interrupt me, specifically, repeatedly, which others do not experience. That precise naming moves you from emotional reaction to clear-eyed understanding. From that place, you can decide how — or whether — to address it.	Name the behaviour precisely. Separate it from the feeling it gives you.	30	situations,patterns,naming behaviour,assertiveness
Q079	EMO	The mask at school	3	youth	You feel like you perform a version of yourself at school that is quite different from who you are at home. This is...	Proof you are two-faced or dishonest	Common and often necessary — different contexts call for different versions of ourselves — but worth checking if the school version ever feels like too much effort	Confusing and should be ignored	Only experienced by you	b	Most people carry different versions of themselves in different settings. The question is not whether you have a school version — almost everyone does — but whether that version costs you too much. If performing who you are at school leaves you exhausted, or feels very far from who you actually are, that gap is worth understanding.	How far is your school version from your home version? What is the distance costing you?	30	emotions,identity,performance,self-awareness
Q080	THINK	Choosing your battles	2	youth	Someone in your class says something that is factually wrong and slightly dismissive about something you care about. You could correct them but it might start an argument. You should...	Always correct people — truth matters	Always stay quiet — it is not worth it	Consider the size of the error, the relationship and whether speaking will help — and then choose	Walk away immediately	c	Not every wrong thing needs to be corrected out loud by you. The question is: does speaking here serve the truth, or does it just serve your need to be right? What is the relationship cost? What is the outcome likely to be? Choosing which moments to speak and which to let go is a mark of real emotional maturity.	What will actually happen if you speak? What do you want the outcome to be?	20	think first,assertiveness,judgement,choosing battles
Q081	SIT	Recognising manipulation	3	youth	Someone keeps making you feel guilty for not spending time with them, even when you have good reasons and have been kind about it. They use phrases like you never care about me or you always choose others. What pattern is this?	Just being honest about their feelings	A guilt-based pattern that uses exaggerated language — always and never — to make you responsible for their feelings	Proof that you are neglecting them	A fair reaction to your behaviour	b	Language like always and never during conflict is rarely literally true — but it is emotionally effective because it makes you feel entirely responsible for the other person. This pattern makes it hard to maintain healthy boundaries because every limit you set becomes evidence that you do not care. Noticing this language is the first step to responding to the feeling without accepting the accusation.	Always and never are rarely true. What is the pattern trying to achieve?	30	situations,manipulation,guilt,boundaries
Q082	EMO	After being left out	1	youth	You were not invited to something all your friends went to. You find out after. You feel a hollow, heavy feeling. This feeling is...	A sign your friends are terrible	Hurt — a real and valid emotion that comes from feeling you did not matter enough to be included	Your fault for something you did	A reason to stop being friends with everyone	b	Being left out genuinely hurts. It is not weak or childish to feel it deeply — belonging matters to human beings in a deep biological way. The hollow, heavy feeling is your system registering that something important to it was missing. You do not have to pretend it does not hurt. You also do not have to decide immediately what it means about your friendships.	The feeling is valid. What you decide it means is still open.	10	emotions,exclusion,hurt,belonging
Q083	THINK	Saying less	2	youth	You are in a conflict and you have a lot you want to say. You feel the urge to explain, justify and defend at length. The most effective choice is often...	Say all of it — more words mean more clarity	Say everything twice to make sure they understand	Say the most important thing clearly and once — then stop talking	Say nothing at all	c	Over-explaining during conflict often weakens your position rather than strengthening it. It can look like anxiety, like you need to convince them rather than simply stating what is true. Saying the key thing clearly and then going quiet is extremely powerful. It puts the next move on them.	Say the important thing. Then stop. Let the silence do work.	20	think first,conflict,assertiveness,communication
Q084	SIT	Kindness that controls	3	youth	Someone is very kind to you — always there, always helping, always giving. But you have noticed that every time you try to do something independently, they seem hurt or step in to take over. This pattern is...	True friendship — they just care about you	Kindness that also keeps you dependent on them — controlling through care rather than through threat	Something to feel guilty about questioning	Only noticeable to ungrateful people	b	Controlling behaviour does not always look threatening. Sometimes it comes wrapped in generosity, concern and helpfulness. The tell is what happens when you try to be independent. If someone's kindness turns wounded when you do not need them, that is information about the function of the kindness. You can appreciate the care while also recognising the pattern.	What happens to their kindness when you do not need it?	30	situations,controlling behaviour,relationships,independence
Q085	EMO	The calm after the storm	2	youth	You have just been through something difficult — an argument, a scary moment, a hard conversation. Afterward, your whole body feels shaky and strange. This is...	A sign something is seriously wrong with you	A completely normal physical response as your body's stress hormones gradually reduce after a period of high alertness	Proof the situation was your fault	Something to hide from others	b	Your stress response is a physical system — it raises heart rate, increases alertness and releases hormones. Coming down from it takes time and produces physical sensations: shaking, strange tiredness, sudden tears or hollow feelings. This is not weakness. It is your biology doing exactly what it should. Rest and warmth help.	Your body was running very hot. What does it need now?	20	emotions,stress response,recovery,body awareness
Q086	SIT	Changing the energy	3	youth	The mood in your friend group has gradually become more negative — more complaining, more putting people down, more cynicism. You have noticed it drifting this way over weeks. You could...	Say nothing since you cannot change group dynamics	Go along with it since it is easier	Introduce something different — a question, a positive story, a different focus — and see if the energy follows	Leave the group entirely	c	Group moods drift. They are not fixed — they accumulate from everyone's small contributions. One person choosing to introduce something different — a funny story, a genuine question, a kind observation — can shift the temperature more than they expect. You do not have to announce that you are doing it. You just do it.	Groups drift. They also redirect. What would you add?	30	situations,group dynamics,positive influence,leadership
Q087	THINK	What I actually want	2	youth	You are about to do something to impress someone in your group. You pause. If you are honest with yourself, do you actually want to do this thing or are you doing it purely to be seen doing it?	It does not matter why — doing it is doing it	Doing things to impress others is always wrong	Asking yourself why you are doing something is a useful habit — acting from genuine choice feels different to acting from social pressure, and you deserve to know the difference	You should always do what others want	c	There is nothing wrong with wanting to be seen or admired — that is deeply human. But knowing whether you are acting from genuine desire or social performance helps you stay connected to yourself. Over time, acting constantly from social performance is exhausting and hollowing. Genuine choice — even if the choice is the same thing — feels different.	Would you do this if no one was watching?	20	think first,identity,choice,authenticity
Q088	EMO	When your face gives it away	2	youth	You are trying to look unbothered but you can feel your face going red, your eyes getting watery or your jaw clenching. You are trying to hold it together in public. What is the most helpful thing to understand about this?	It is a humiliating failure	Physical emotional responses are involuntary — they are not something you did wrong, and most people in that situation experience the same thing	It means you are weak	Everyone is judging you	b	Your body's physical response to strong emotion — flushing, trembling, eyes filling — is not under conscious control in the moment. These are involuntary responses, not performances. Almost everyone has experienced them. Trying harder to suppress them often makes them stronger. The most useful thing in that moment is to let the physical response happen while choosing what you do next.	Your body's reaction and your next action are two different things.	20	emotions,physical response,social anxiety,self-compassion
Q089	SIT	The reputation gap	3	youth	Someone has a reputation for being difficult or unkind. When you actually spend time with them one-to-one, they seem quite different. You should...	Ignore your direct experience and stick with the group's reputation	Report back to the group that the reputation is wrong	Hold both pieces of information carefully — what you directly experienced and what others have reported — and let your understanding be richer than either one alone	Never mention it to anyone	c	Reputation and direct experience are both real information — but they are different kinds of information. Reputation is what many people across time have experienced or said. Direct experience is what you specifically found in that moment. Good thinkers hold both and let their understanding be complex rather than choosing one or the other.	What does your direct experience add to what you already heard?	30	situations,judgement,reputation,critical thinking
Q090	THINK	Being the same person	2	youth	You notice that who you are depends a lot on who you are with — you are louder with some people, quieter with others, funnier with some, more serious with others. This is...	Fake and dishonest	Normal social adapting — but it is worth checking whether any version of you requires you to be someone you do not recognise or do not like	Evidence you have no real personality	Something to be ashamed of	b	Adapting to different social contexts is normal and healthy. You speak differently to a teacher than to a best friend, and that is appropriate. The question worth asking is whether any of your social versions requires you to act against your own values or to be someone you genuinely do not like. If so, that version is costing you something.	Which version of you do you most recognise as actually you?	20	think first,identity,authenticity,self-awareness
Q091	SIT	Who benefits	3	youth	Something has happened in your friend group and someone is telling the story in a very specific way that makes them look good and someone else look bad. Before accepting the story, it is useful to ask...	Why would anyone lie to their friends?	Nothing — they are telling you because they trust you	Who benefits from you believing this version of events?	Whether the absent person is really as bad as described	c	Asking who benefits from a particular version of events is one of the most useful critical thinking tools you can use. It is not the same as assuming someone is lying. It is recognising that all storytelling involves choices — what to include, what to leave out, what to emphasise — and those choices are usually shaped by self-interest. Understanding this makes you a better reader of situations.	Who comes out looking good in this story? Did they tell it?	30	situations,critical thinking,bias,stories
Q092	EMO	Anxiety as a signal not a sentence	3	youth	You feel very anxious about something coming up. The anxiety is telling you...	That the thing will definitely go badly	That you are weak and should avoid challenges	That something matters to you and your system is preparing for it — anxiety is a signal, not a prediction	You should cancel whatever it is	c	Anxiety is often misread as a prediction — I feel anxious therefore something bad will happen. But anxiety is actually your nervous system preparing you for something that matters. It is energy, not prophecy.

Q093	THINK	Loyalty and truth	3	youth	Your best friend did something that hurt another person and is now asking you to cover for them or deny what happened. You know what actually happened. This is...	An easy choice — loyalty to friends comes first	A situation where your value for honesty is in direct tension with your loyalty to your friend — and how you handle it defines your character	Something you should avoid thinking about	Only a problem if someone finds out	b	Being asked to lie for someone you care about puts two important values in direct conflict — honesty and loyalty. There is no easy answer. But it is worth knowing that agreeing to cover for someone can damage your own integrity and often does not actually help your friend face the consequences of their actions. Real loyalty sometimes means not making it easier for someone to avoid accountability.	What does real loyalty actually mean here?	30	think first,honesty,loyalty,values
Q094	SIT	The silent treatment	2	youth	Someone who is usually friendly is suddenly not speaking to you. They have not told you why. You do not know what you did. The most useful first step is...	Panic and mentally review everything you might have done wrong	Ignore them back	Calmly ask if everything is okay between you, once, without pressure — and then give them space to respond	Tell other people what they are doing	c	The silent treatment — being shut out without explanation — is genuinely difficult because it denies you the information you need to understand what happened. Calmly checking in once is fair and direct. Then waiting, without escalating or guessing wildly, gives both of you space. You cannot fix something you do not understand.	Ask once, calmly. Then wait.	20	situations,relationships,conflict,communication
Q095	EMO	Contagious emotions	2	youth	You were fine before you arrived, but after spending time with a very anxious or very negative person, you feel worse yourself. What happened?	They infected you with something	Nothing — feelings come entirely from inside you	You probably absorbed some of their emotional state — emotions are genuinely contagious and our nervous systems respond to the people around us	You were tired already	c	Human beings are wired to catch emotions from each other. It is called emotional contagion and it is a real neurological process. Spending time with someone in a highly anxious or negative state can genuinely leave you feeling some version of that. Knowing this means you can recognise it and choose your response rather than simply wondering why you feel worse.	Where did that feeling actually come from?	20	emotions,emotional contagion,awareness,self-protection
Q096	THINK	Not making it worse	1	youth	You are in a situation that is already tense. You feel the urge to say something sharp or funny that will show everyone you are not bothered. Before you say it, ask yourself...	Will saying this actually make this moment better or am I just performing toughness?	Is what I am about to say funny?	Will this impress the dominant person?	Is this true?	a	Sharp comments in tense moments can feel like armour — they signal I am fine and in control. But they often escalate rather than de-escalate, and they can feel hollow rather than genuinely confident. The question worth asking is whether you are serving the moment or serving your image.	Are you doing this for the room or for yourself?	10	think first,de-escalation,self-awareness,social pressure
Q097	SIT	Reading support	1	youth	You are struggling with something and a friend sits with you, does not say much, but stays close. This kind of support is called...	Unhelpful since they should be giving you advice	Companionship or presence — sometimes being with someone without advice or solutions is the most helpful thing possible	Strange behaviour	Pity	b	Not all support comes in words or advice. Sometimes the most powerful thing another person can do is simply stay. Presence without pressure — sitting near someone, staying with them in a quiet moment — is a real and important form of care. Noticing when you need this from others, and when you can offer it, is an important social skill.	What was their silence actually saying?	10	situations,support,friendship,empathy
Q098	EMO	The reset moment	2	youth	After a really hard emotional experience, you notice that certain things help you feel like yourself again — a walk, music, drawing, food, time alone. These are...	Avoidance tactics	Your personal regulation tools — the things your nervous system has learned help it recover	Signs you are not dealing with the problem properly	Childish	b	Every person's nervous system has things that help it come back from high states of stress or emotion. Walks, music, creative activities, food, solitude, talking — these are not avoidance, they are recovery. Knowing yours is one of the most practically useful things you can learn about yourself. You cannot think clearly from inside a storm. These tools help you get to the other side of it.	What brings you back to yourself?	20	emotions,regulation,recovery,self-knowledge
Q099	SIT	When you do not know where you stand	2	youth	You cannot tell if someone likes you or not — they are warm one day and cold the next, friendly in private and distant in public. This inconsistency...	Means they definitely dislike you	Is probably a reflection of something in their own situation rather than a clear signal about how they feel about you — inconsistency is hard to read and often not about you	Is your fault	Is normal for everyone	b	Inconsistency is one of the hardest social experiences to navigate because it denies you reliable information. It is important to recognise that someone's hot-cold behaviour is usually about something going on for them — managing their own anxiety, navigating group pressure, dealing with something at home — and not a clear verdict on you.	Is their inconsistency really about you?	20	situations,relationships,uncertainty,self-protection
Q100	THINK	The choice to stay yourself	3	youth	You are in a situation where fitting in would require you to be unkind, dishonest or someone you do not recognise. The clearest version of strength in that moment is...	Fitting in, because belonging matters	Arguing loudly about your values	Quietly remaining who you are, even without making a speech about it — your actions speak without requiring an audience	Leaving every situation that makes you uncomfortable	c	The strongest version of yourself is not the loudest or the most confrontational. It is the most consistent. Staying who you are, without performing it, without needing anyone to notice — in a moment where the pressure is to become something else — that is what genuine character looks like. It does not require an audience. It just requires you.	You do not need to announce your values. You just need to live them.	30	think first,identity,values,character,integrity
