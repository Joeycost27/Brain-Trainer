GB-001	Working Memory	Verbal Recall	both	1	You just heard this list of words: {{WORDS_4}}. Which word was FIRST in the list?	WORDS_4	words[0]	other_words_from_list	word	10	20	false	The first word is the one you heard before any others.	Working memory stores things in the order you received them. Recalling the first item tests the start of your memory sequence.	recall, sequence, verbal
GB-002	Working Memory	Verbal Recall	both	1	You just heard this list of words: {{WORDS_4}}. Which word was LAST in the list?	WORDS_4	words[3]	other_words_from_list	word	10	20	false	The last word is the final one in the sequence.	The last item in a list is often easiest to recall — this is called the recency effect. Notice if you find it easier than recalling the first.	recall, sequence, verbal
GB-003	Working Memory	Verbal Recall	both	2	You just heard this list of words: {{WORDS_5}}. Which word was THIRD in the list?	WORDS_5	words[2]	other_words_from_list	word	25	18	false	Count along the list: 1st, 2nd, 3rd — stop there.	Middle items in a list are hardest to recall — this is the serial position effect. Practising middle recall directly strengthens working memory.	recall, sequence, middle, verbal
GB-004	Working Memory	Verbal Recall	adult	2	You just heard this list of words: {{WORDS_6}}. Which word was FOURTH in the list?	WORDS_6	words[3]	other_words_from_list	word	25	18	false	Count through: 1, 2, 3, 4 — which word lands on 4?	Recalling the 4th of 6 items targets the challenging middle zone of verbal working memory.	recall, sequence, verbal, adult
GB-005	Working Memory	Verbal Recall	both	3	You just heard this list: {{WORDS_6}}. Which of these was NOT in the list?	WORDS_6,DECOY_WORD	decoy_word	words_from_list	word	50	15	false	One of the options was never in the list — it is the intruder.	Identifying an item that was NOT in a set is harder than recall — it requires you to hold the full list and compare against it.	recognition, decoy, verbal, boss
GB-006	Working Memory	Number Sequences	both	1	Here is a number sequence: {{NUMBERS_4}}. What number comes NEXT if the pattern continues?	NUMBERS_4_ARITHMETIC	next_in_sequence	near_misses_of_next	number	10	22	false	Look at the gap between each number — is it always the same?	Arithmetic sequences increase or decrease by the same amount each step. Finding the pattern then extending it is a core working memory + reasoning skill.	numbers, pattern, sequence
GB-007	Working Memory	Number Sequences	both	2	Here is a number sequence: {{NUMBERS_5}}. What is the MISSING number: {{SEQ_WITH_GAP}}?	NUMBERS_5_ARITHMETIC_GAP	missing_value	near_misses	number	25	20	false	Find the step size between the numbers you can see, then fill the gap.	Identifying a missing item inside a sequence is harder than extending one — it requires pattern recognition in both directions.	numbers, missing, pattern, sequence
GB-008	Working Memory	Number Sequences	adult	3	Here is a sequence: {{NUMBERS_6}}. The pattern is NOT simple addition. What comes next?	NUMBERS_6_MULTIPLY	next_in_sequence	near_misses_of_next	number	50	18	false	Try multiplying rather than adding — what is the relationship?	Multiplicative sequences require holding more complex rules in working memory, training more demanding cognitive control.	numbers, multiply, pattern, boss
GB-009	Working Memory	Digit Span	both	1	Listen to this number: {{DIGITS_4}}. Type it back in the SAME order. Which of these is correct?	DIGITS_4	exact_digit_string	scrambled_variants	digit_string	10	15	false	Repeat exactly what you heard — same order, no changes.	Digit span forward is the simplest working memory test. Most people can hold 5–7 digits. Track your limit over time.	digits, span, forward, recall
GB-010	Working Memory	Digit Span	both	2	Listen to this number: {{DIGITS_5}}. Now reverse it and choose the BACKWARDS version.	DIGITS_5	reversed_digit_string	partial_reversal_variants	digit_string	25	18	false	Flip the whole number — last digit becomes first.	Backwards digit span requires active manipulation, not just passive storage — it is significantly harder and more trainable.	digits, span, backward, manipulation
GB-011	Working Memory	Story Recall	both	1	{{NAME}} went to {{PLACE}} and bought {{OBJECT}} and {{OBJECT2}}. What did {{NAME}} buy FIRST?	NAME,PLACE,OBJECT,OBJECT2	object	object2_and_distractors	word	10	20	false	The first thing bought is mentioned before "and" in the sentence.	Narrative recall mirrors real-life instruction following. Tracking sequence within a story is a daily working memory demand.	story, recall, narrative, sequence
GB-012	Working Memory	Story Recall	both	2	{{NAME}} did three things today: {{TASK}}, then {{TASK2}}, then {{TASK3}}. What was the SECOND thing?	NAME,TASK,TASK2,TASK3	task2	task_and_task3_and_distractor	phrase	25	20	false	Count along — first, second. Stop at second.	Three-step narrative recall is a core executive function demand — it mirrors following multi-step instructions at school and work.	story, recall, three-step, narrative
GB-013	Working Memory	Visual Memory	youth	1	You just saw {{NUMBER}} objects on a tray. One was a {{OBJECT}}. Which of these was ALSO on the tray?	NUMBER,OBJECT,OBJECT2,DECOY1,DECOY2	object2	decoy1_and_decoy2_and_distractor	word	10	20	false	Picture the tray in your mind — what else was there?	Visual working memory stores snapshots of what we see. Practising retrieval from a mental image strengthens this store directly.	visual, tray, objects, youth
GB-014	Working Memory	Visual Memory	both	2	You studied a list of {{NUMBER}} items. Which TWO of these were in the original list?	NUMBER,ITEMS_SET,DECOYS	two_correct_items	one_correct_one_wrong_pairs	word_pair	25	22	false	Hold the whole list in your head and check each option against it.	Identifying multiple correct items from a mixed set demands more capacity from visual working memory than single-item recall.	visual, multiple, recognition, memory
GB-015	Focus Stamina	Sustained Attention	both	1	Read this sentence carefully: "{{SENTENCE_WITH_ERROR}}". How many times does the letter {{LETTER}} appear?	SENTENCE,LETTER,COUNT	correct_count	near_count_variants	number	10	25	false	Go slowly — letter by letter. Don't rush.	Counting a specific letter in a sentence is a direct test of sustained, selective attention. Speed is the enemy — slow wins.	attention, counting, letters, careful
GB-016	Focus Stamina	Sustained Attention	both	2	In this sequence of symbols — {{SYMBOL_SEQUENCE}} — how many times does {{TARGET_SYMBOL}} appear?	SYMBOL_SEQUENCE,TARGET_SYMBOL,COUNT	correct_count	near_count_variants	number	25	22	false	Scan from left to right, once per symbol — don't jump around.	Symbol scanning trains the same neural pathway used when reading, tracking, and monitoring for specific targets in a busy environment.	attention, symbols, scanning, counting
GB-017	Focus Stamina	Distraction Resistance	both	2	Ignore the distracting words and answer this: {{DISTRACTOR_MATH}}. What is the answer?	MATH_WITH_DISTRACTORS,ANSWER	correct_answer	near_answers	number	25	20	false	Ignore the words — focus only on the numbers.	Filtering irrelevant information while solving a problem directly mirrors real-world distraction resistance — a core focus skill.	distraction, filtering, maths, attention
GB-018	Focus Stamina	Task Switching	adult	2	You were counting by {{N}}s starting from {{START}}. You got to {{CURRENT}}. What is the NEXT number?	N,START,CURRENT	current_plus_n	near_misses	number	25	18	false	Add the step size to the number you stopped at.	Mental counting with a step size trains the ability to hold a rule in working memory while applying it — essential for task focus.	counting, rules, working memory, adult
GB-019	Focus Stamina	Task Switching	both	3	Switch task: first count the {{COLOUR}} words, then count the {{COLOUR2}} words. How many {{COLOUR}} words are there in: {{WORD_LIST_MIXED_COLOURS}}?	COLOUR,COLOUR2,WORD_LIST	colour_count	near_count_variants	number	50	20	true	Ignore {{COLOUR2}} completely — count only {{COLOUR}}.	Task switching under selective attention pressure mimics real cognitive demands — filtering one stream while ignoring another is a trainable executive function.	task switching, selective attention, boss, colours
GB-020	Focus Stamina	Attention Recovery	both	2	You were reading and lost your place. The last thing you read was: "{{PHRASE}}". What word most likely comes NEXT in a normal sentence?	PHRASE,NEXT_WORD	correct_next_word	plausible_wrong_words	word	25	20	false	Think about what makes grammatical sense after that phrase.	Predicting what comes next after losing focus is exactly the recovery skill needed in reading and listening — it trains attention reorientation.	attention, recovery, reading, prediction
GB-021	Impulse Management	Pause Recognition	both	1	{{NAME}} is in class and knows the answer. The teacher is still talking. What is the BEST thing to do?	NAME	wait_and_raise_hand_when_asked	blurt_out_answer_or_interrupt	scenario_choice	10	20	false	What would a good pause look like here?	Recognising the right moment to speak — and choosing to wait — is the foundation of impulse control in social situations.	impulse, pause, social, classroom
GB-022	Impulse Management	Pause Recognition	both	1	{{NAME}} really wants the last biscuit but it was not offered to them. What should {{NAME}} do?	NAME	ask_politely_or_wait	grab_it_or_take_without_asking	scenario_choice	10	20	false	What is the pause between wanting and acting?	Pausing between desire and action is the core impulse management skill. Naming the pause makes it a conscious choice.	impulse, wanting, pause, social
GB-023	Impulse Management	Consequence Mapping	youth	2	{{NAME}} is angry and wants to shout at a friend. If {{NAME}} shouts, what is the MOST LIKELY result?	NAME	friend_feels_hurt_or_leaves	nothing_happens_or_friend_laughs	scenario_outcome	25	22	false	Think one step forward — what happens right after the shout?	Mapping consequences before acting is the cognitive step that impulse control depends on. This practises that step explicitly.	impulse, consequences, anger, social
GB-024	Impulse Management	Consequence Mapping	adult	2	You receive an email that makes you angry. You want to reply immediately. What is the SMARTEST next step?	none	wait_and_reread_before_replying	reply_immediately_or_delete	scenario_choice	25	20	false	What creates the best outcome — speed or a pause?	The reactive reply is almost never the best reply. Recognising the impulse and inserting a gap is a trainable adult executive function.	impulse, email, adult, reactive
GB-025	Impulse Management	Delay Strategies	both	2	{{NAME}} wants to buy something they saw online right now. Which strategy is MOST likely to prevent an impulsive purchase?	NAME	add_to_wishlist_and_wait_24hrs	buy_now_or_ask_someone_else	strategy_choice	25	22	false	Which option puts the most time between wanting and buying?	The 24-hour cart rule is one of the most effective impulse delay strategies — it uses time as the intervention.	impulse, spending, delay, strategy
GB-026	Impulse Management	Self-Monitoring	both	1	You feel a strong urge to do something right now. On a scale of 1–10, how URGENT does it actually need to be? The urge appeared {{TIME_AGO}}. What rating is most realistic?	TIME_AGO,URGENCY_RATING	realistic_lower_rating	inflated_ratings	number_1_to_10	10	20	false	Urges feel 10/10 urgent but rarely are — what is the honest number?	Self-monitoring the intensity of an urge is the first step to managing it. Most urges rated 9 or 10 drop significantly within minutes.	impulse, urgency, self-monitoring, rating
GB-027	Impulse Management	Emotion-Action Gap	both	2	{{NAME}} feels frustrated because {{SCENARIO}}. Which action creates the BEST outcome?	NAME,SCENARIO	pause_breathe_then_respond	react_immediately_or_give_up	scenario_choice	25	22	false	What action keeps options open rather than closing them?	The gap between emotion and action is where executive function lives. Widening that gap is the whole goal of impulse management training.	impulse, frustration, gap, choice
GB-028	Impulse Management	Rule Following	youth	2	The game rule says wait 3 seconds before answering. {{NAME}} knows the answer instantly. What should {{NAME}} do?	NAME	wait_3_seconds_then_answer	answer_immediately	scenario_choice	25	18	false	The rule exists for a reason — following it is the challenge.	Following rules that feel unnecessary to us in the moment is a direct exercise of impulse control. The delay IS the training.	impulse, rules, waiting, youth
GB-029	Executive Function	Prioritisation	both	1	{{NAME}} has 3 things to do: {{TASK}} (due today), {{TASK2}} (due next week), {{TASK3}} (would be nice to do). What should {{NAME}} do FIRST?	NAME,TASK,TASK2,TASK3	task_due_today	task2_or_task3	task_phrase	10	22	false	Which task has the most urgent deadline?	Prioritising by urgency and importance is the foundation of executive planning. The due-today task is almost always the right first move.	planning, priority, urgency, executive
GB-030	Executive Function	Prioritisation	adult	2	You have 4 tasks: {{TASK}} (urgent + important), {{TASK2}} (urgent, not important), {{TASK3}} (important, not urgent), {{TASK4}} (neither). Which is your FIRST priority?	TASK,TASK2,TASK3,TASK4	urgent_and_important_task	other_three_tasks	task_phrase	25	20	false	Urgent AND important beats urgent alone every time.	The Eisenhower matrix distinguishes between urgency and importance. Doing urgent-but-unimportant tasks first is one of the most common productivity mistakes.	planning, eisenhower, adult, priority
GB-031	Executive Function	Task Initiation	both	1	{{NAME}} has been avoiding {{TASK}} for 3 days. The SMALLEST possible starting action is which of these?	NAME,TASK	smallest_micro_action	full_task_or_large_step	micro_action_phrase	10	22	false	What is the tiniest thing that counts as starting?	The 2-minute rule — start with the smallest possible action — is the most effective intervention for task avoidance in executive dysfunction.	initiation, avoidance, starting, small steps
GB-032	Executive Function	Task Initiation	youth	1	{{NAME}} does not want to start homework. Which of these would make it EASIEST to begin?	NAME	sit_down_open_one_book	think_about_it_or_watch_tv_first	scenario_choice	10	20	false	The easiest start is the one with the fewest steps.	Reducing the number of steps required to begin a task lowers the activation energy — making the start almost automatic.	initiation, homework, youth, starting
GB-033	Executive Function	Planning	both	2	{{NAME}} needs to complete {{PROJECT}} by {{DAY}}. Today is {{TODAY}}. How many days are left to complete it?	NAME,PROJECT,DAY,TODAY,DAYS_LEFT	correct_days_left	near_day_counts	number	25	20	false	Count forward from today to the deadline.	Time awareness — knowing exactly how many days remain — is the first step of realistic planning. Many people avoid this calculation.	planning, deadlines, time, counting
GB-034	Executive Function	Planning	both	2	A task has 4 steps. Step 2 CANNOT start until Step 1 is done. Step 3 can start any time. Which step should start FIRST?	none	step_1	step_2_or_step_3_or_step_4	step_number	25	18	false	Which step is blocking everything else?	Identifying the critical path — the step that everything else depends on — is an advanced planning skill that prevents last-minute bottlenecks.	planning, dependencies, critical path, sequencing
GB-035	Executive Function	Organisation	youth	1	{{NAME}} cannot find their {{OBJECT}}. They last had it at {{PLACE}}. Where should they look FIRST?	NAME,OBJECT,PLACE	last_known_location	random_other_locations	place_name	10	20	false	Start where you last had it — not where you wish it was.	Systematic search starting from the last known location is a basic organisational and memory strategy that dramatically reduces search time.	organisation, finding, systematic, youth
GB-036	Executive Function	Organisation	adult	2	{{NAME}} has 6 tasks to do today but only 3 hours. Each task takes {{TIME}} mins. How many tasks can realistically be completed?	NAME,TIME,HOURS	floor_of_hours_times_60_divided_by_time	over_or_under_estimates	number	25	20	false	Divide total available minutes by minutes per task.	Realistic time budgeting — matching tasks to available time before starting — is one of the highest-leverage executive function skills.	organisation, time budgeting, realistic, adult
GB-037	Executive Function	Transitions	both	1	{{NAME}} is deeply focused on {{ACTIVITY}} and needs to switch to {{NEXT_TASK}} in 5 minutes. What is the BEST thing to do RIGHT NOW?	NAME,ACTIVITY,NEXT_TASK	set_a_5_minute_timer_warning	keep_going_and_switch_when_ready_or_stop_immediately	strategy_choice	10	20	false	A warning signal before a transition makes the switch much easier.	Transition warnings give the brain time to prepare for a context switch — significantly reducing the friction of stopping an engaging activity.	transitions, warning, switching, planning
GB-038	Executive Function	Goal Setting	both	2	{{NAME}} wants to achieve {{GOAL}} in {{TIMEFRAME}}. The goal is vague. Which version is MOST specific and achievable?	NAME,GOAL,TIMEFRAME,SPECIFIC_VERSION	most_specific_measurable_version	vague_versions	goal_phrase	25	22	false	A good goal says exactly what, how much, and by when.	Specific, measurable goals are far more likely to be achieved than vague ones. The brain needs a clear target to direct action toward.	goals, specific, measurable, planning
GB-039	Emotional Regulation	Feelings Identification	both	1	{{NAME}} just got a lower mark than expected on a test they worked hard for. What emotion is {{NAME}} MOST likely feeling?	NAME	disappointed_or_frustrated	happy_or_surprised_or_bored	emotion_word	10	20	false	Think about what it feels like when effort doesn't match result.	Accurately labelling emotions in context is the foundation of emotional regulation. Named emotions are easier to manage than unnamed ones.	emotions, labelling, disappointment, context
GB-040	Emotional Regulation	Feelings Identification	youth	1	{{NAME}} is about to perform in front of a crowd for the first time. Their heart is beating fast. What are they MOST likely feeling?	NAME	nervous_or_excited	angry_or_sad_or_bored	emotion_word	10	18	false	Fast heartbeat before a big moment — which emotion fits best?	Physical sensations map to emotions. Learning to read body signals as emotional information is a key self-awareness skill.	emotions, body, nervous, youth
GB-041	Emotional Regulation	Regulation Strategies	both	2	{{NAME}} is feeling overwhelmed and cannot think clearly. Which strategy is MOST likely to help RIGHT NOW?	NAME	slow_deep_breathing_or_grounding	thinking_harder_or_pushing_through	strategy_choice	25	20	false	When overwhelmed, the nervous system needs calming before thinking can improve.	Physiological regulation (breathing, grounding) directly reduces cortisol and activates the prefrontal cortex — making clearer thinking possible.	regulation, overwhelm, breathing, strategy
GB-042	Emotional Regulation	Regulation Strategies	youth	1	{{NAME}} is very angry and about to say something they might regret. What should they do FIRST?	NAME	pause_and_take_a_breath	say_it_anyway_or_run_away	strategy_choice	10	20	false	What creates space between the feeling and the words?	The pause before speaking when angry is the single most effective emotional regulation move in social situations.	regulation, anger, pause, youth
GB-043	Emotional Regulation	Frustration Tolerance	both	2	{{NAME}} has tried {{TASK}} {{NUMBER}} times and keeps getting it wrong. What is the MOST helpful thought to have?	NAME,TASK,NUMBER	each_attempt_is_learning_not_failure	i_am_bad_at_this_or_this_is_impossible	thought_choice	25	22	false	Which thought keeps you going rather than stopping you?	Reframing repeated failure as iterative learning is the cognitive core of frustration tolerance and growth mindset.	frustration, reframe, persistence, mindset
GB-044	Emotional Regulation	Self-Compassion	youth	2	{{NAME}} made a mistake in front of their class and feels embarrassed. Which thought is MOST self-compassionate?	NAME	everyone_makes_mistakes_and_it_will_pass	i_am_so_stupid_or_everyone_hates_me_now	thought_choice	25	20	false	What would a kind friend say to you right now?	Self-compassionate responses to mistakes reduce shame, improve resilience, and lead to better future performance than self-criticism.	self-compassion, mistakes, embarrassment, youth
GB-045	Emotional Regulation	Resilience	both	2	{{NAME}} failed at something important. What is the MOST resilient next step?	NAME	reflect_briefly_then_try_again_differently	give_up_or_pretend_it_did_not_happen	scenario_choice	25	20	false	Resilience is not about never failing — it is about what happens next.	Bouncing back from failure by reflecting and adjusting (not just repeating or quitting) is the core of psychological resilience.	resilience, failure, recovery, growth
GB-046	Emotional Regulation	Anxiety Management	both	2	{{NAME}} is worrying about something that might happen {{TIMEFRAME}} from now. What is the MOST useful thing to do with that worry?	NAME,TIMEFRAME	write_it_down_and_set_a_time_to_think_about_it	worry_about_it_all_day_or_ignore_it_completely	strategy_choice	25	22	false	Can you contain the worry to a specific time rather than spreading it through the day?	Scheduled worry time — containing anxiety to a specific window — reduces the total worry load and teaches the brain that concerns are manageable.	anxiety, worry, scheduling, management
GB-047	Emotional Regulation	Emotional Vocabulary	both	1	{{NAME}} feels something between sad and angry. Which single word BEST describes this mixed emotion?	NAME	frustrated_or_resentful	happy_or_scared_or_confused	emotion_word	10	20	false	Look for the word that sits between both feelings.	Expanding emotional vocabulary beyond "good" and "bad" gives the brain more precise tools for identifying, communicating and regulating feelings.	emotions, vocabulary, nuance, awareness
GB-048	Emotional Regulation	Trigger Awareness	adult	2	{{NAME}} always gets irritable at {{TIME_OF_DAY}}. What is the MOST likely explanation to investigate first?	NAME,TIME_OF_DAY	hunger_or_energy_drop_or_stress_peak	random_or_other_people_fault	explanation_choice	25	20	false	Recurring patterns in mood usually have a recurring physical or situational cause.	Identifying personal mood triggers turns reactive emotional experiences into predictable patterns that can be managed proactively.	triggers, patterns, adult, mood
GB-049	Technical Planning	Scope Definition	both	1	{{NAME}} is asked to "clean the house." Which action MOST clearly defines what done looks like?	NAME	write_exactly_which_rooms_and_what_clean_means	start_cleaning_or_ask_no_questions	clarification_choice	10	22	false	You cannot plan well if you do not know exactly what is in scope.	Defining scope before starting prevents task expansion, reduces anxiety, and makes it possible to know when you are truly finished.	planning, scope, done, clarity
GB-050	Technical Planning	Scope Definition	youth	1	{{NAME}} is told to "tidy your room." What is the FIRST thing they should do?	NAME	decide_exactly_what_tidy_means_for_today	start_immediately_or_ask_how_long	clarification_choice	10	20	false	What does "tidy" actually mean? That needs defining first.	Children with planning difficulties benefit enormously from externalising the definition of done before beginning — it removes the invisible goalposts.	planning, scope, youth, tidy
GB-051	Technical Planning	Task Anatomy	both	2	The task is: "Write a thank-you letter." How many SEPARATE actions does this task actually contain?	none	at_least_4_actions	1_or_2_actions	number_range	25	20	false	Think: decide what to say, find paper, write, address, post — count them all.	Most tasks that feel simple contain 4–8 discrete actions. Seeing all the steps before starting prevents mid-task surprises and stalls.	planning, decomposition, actions, anatomy
GB-052	Technical Planning	Task Anatomy	youth	2	{{NAME}} needs to make a birthday card for a friend. Which list shows the CORRECT order of steps?	NAME	think_design_draw_write_give	give_write_draw_think_design	ordered_list	25	20	false	What has to happen before each step can begin?	Identifying the correct sequence of task steps prevents wasted effort and the frustration of doing things in the wrong order.	planning, sequencing, order, youth
GB-053	Technical Planning	Dependency Mapping	both	2	{{NAME}} cannot start Step 3 of a task until Step {{BLOCK_STEP}} is complete. Step {{BLOCK_STEP}} takes {{TIME}} minutes. How long must {{NAME}} wait before starting Step 3?	NAME,BLOCK_STEP,TIME	correct_wait_time	wrong_time_estimates	time_phrase	25	18	false	The wait time equals the duration of the blocking step.	Understanding dependency chains — what must finish before what can start — is the planning skill that prevents last-minute deadline crises.	planning, dependencies, waiting, sequence
GB-054	Technical Planning	Resource Mapping	both	1	{{NAME}} is about to start {{TASK}} and realises they are missing {{MATERIAL}}. What should they do?	NAME,TASK,MATERIAL	get_material_before_starting	start_anyway_or_skip_material	decision_choice	10	20	false	Starting without what you need guarantees an interruption.	Completing a resource check before starting a task is a simple habit that prevents the focus-breaking disruption of mid-task discovery.	planning, resources, preparation, materials
GB-055	Technical Planning	Time Estimation	both	2	{{NAME}} estimated {{TASK}} would take {{ESTIMATE}} minutes. It actually took {{ACTUAL}} minutes. Were they over or under, and by how much?	NAME,TASK,ESTIMATE,ACTUAL,DIFF	over_or_under_and_diff	wrong_direction_or_wrong_amount	estimation_result	25	20	false	Subtract smaller from larger, then decide which direction the error went.	Tracking estimation errors is the fastest way to improve time awareness — the act of comparing prediction to reality recalibrates future estimates.	planning, time, estimation, calibration
GB-056	Technical Planning	Contingency Planning	both	2	{{NAME}}'s plan depends on {{DEPENDENCY}} being available. It is NOT available. What is the BEST response?	NAME,DEPENDENCY	activate_plan_b_or_find_alternative	panic_or_give_up_or_wait	response_choice	25	20	false	A plan B should already exist for the most likely failure.	Contingency planning — preparing a response to the most likely disruption — converts unexpected events from crises into managed transitions.	planning, contingency, plan b, resilience
GB-057	Technical Planning	Daily Planning	both	1	{{NAME}} has {{NUMBER}} tasks today and only {{HOURS}} hours. The tasks total {{TOTAL_MINS}} minutes. Is the plan realistic?	NAME,NUMBER,HOURS,TOTAL_MINS	yes_if_total_mins_fits_or_no_if_not	opposite_answer	yes_no	10	18	false	Convert hours to minutes, then compare to total task time.	The most common planning failure is not accounting for whether tasks actually fit in available time. This check takes 30 seconds.	planning, daily, realistic, time
GB-058	Technical Planning	Review & Adjustment	both	2	{{NAME}} finished a task but it took twice as long as planned. What is the MOST useful thing to record?	NAME	what_caused_the_delay_and_revised_time_estimate	nothing_or_just_how_frustrated_they_were	record_choice	25	20	false	The insight is more valuable than the frustration — record the cause.	Post-task review of time discrepancies is the fastest way to improve future planning accuracy. The data from one task improves ten future ones.	planning, review, improvement, reflection
GB-059	Technical Planning	Weekly Planning	adult	2	It is Sunday. {{NAME}} has {{NUMBER}} commitments next week. Which should be scheduled FIRST in the calendar?	NAME,NUMBER	fixed_non_negotiable_commitments	flexible_tasks_or_nice_to_haves	commitment_type	25	20	false	Fixed commitments define the shape of the week — plan around them.	Weekly planning works best when you first block out fixed commitments, then fit flexible tasks around them — not the other way round.	planning, weekly, adult, calendar
GB-060	Technical Planning	Task Batching	adult	2	{{NAME}} has these tasks: reply to 3 emails, make 2 phone calls, write a report, read 2 articles. Which tasks should be BATCHED together?	NAME	emails_together_and_calls_together	mix_all_types_or_random	batch_grouping	25	22	false	Group tasks of the same TYPE — they use the same mental mode.	Task batching reduces the cognitive cost of context switching. Similar tasks share the same mental setup, so doing them together is faster and less draining.	planning, batching, efficiency, adult
GB-061	Real-World Application	Morning Routine	youth	1	{{NAME}}'s school starts at {{TIME}} and it takes {{TRAVEL_MINS}} mins to get there. They need 30 mins to get ready. What is the LATEST they can wake up?	NAME,TIME,TRAVEL_MINS	time_minus_travel_minus_30	wrong_time_calculations	time	25	20	false	Work backwards: school time minus travel time minus getting ready time.	Backward time planning from a fixed deadline is the most practical daily planning skill — and one of the most commonly underdeveloped.	routine, morning, time, backwards planning
GB-062	Real-World Application	Morning Routine	both	1	A smooth morning routine has steps in a set order. Which is the correct order?	none	wake_eat_dress_pack_leave	dress_wake_pack_eat_leave_or_random	ordered_sequence	10	20	false	What has to happen before each step can begin?	Sequencing a morning routine reveals natural dependencies — you cannot dress before waking, cannot leave before packing. Order matters.	routine, morning, sequence, order
GB-063	Real-World Application	Study Skills	youth	2	{{NAME}} just read a chapter. Which technique will help them REMEMBER it best?	NAME	close_book_and_write_what_they_remember	reread_it_or_highlight_everything	technique_choice	25	20	false	The act of retrieving information — not re-reading — is what builds memory.	Active recall (closing the book and retrieving) is 3× more effective than re-reading for long-term retention. The effort of retrieval IS the learning.	studying, recall, youth, learning
GB-064	Real-World Application	Study Skills	both	2	{{NAME}} has a test on {{SUBJECT}} in {{DAYS}} days. They have {{HOURS}} hours available. How many hours per day should they study?	NAME,SUBJECT,DAYS,HOURS	hours_divided_by_days	wrong_division_results	number	25	18	false	Divide total hours by total days to get daily study time.	Spreading study time evenly over available days is more effective than cramming — and requires basic forward planning from today.	studying, planning, time, daily
GB-065	Real-World Application	Work Productivity	adult	2	{{NAME}} starts work at {{START_TIME}} and has {{TASK}} as their most important task. When should they do it?	NAME,START_TIME,TASK	first_thing_before_checking_messages	after_emails_or_in_the_afternoon	time_choice	25	20	false	Do the most important thing before the day has a chance to hijack you.	Most Important Task first — before messages and reactive work — is the highest-leverage daily productivity habit for adult attention management.	productivity, adult, MIT, morning
GB-066	Real-World Application	Time Management	both	1	{{NAME}} has a meeting at {{TIME}}. They need {{PREP_MINS}} minutes to prepare. What is the LATEST they should start preparing?	NAME,TIME,PREP_MINS	time_minus_prep_mins	wrong_time_or_on_the_dot	time	10	18	false	Subtract preparation time from meeting time.	Buffer planning — working backwards from a fixed event to determine preparation start time — prevents the rushed, underprepared state that derails focus.	time management, buffer, backwards planning, meetings
GB-067	Real-World Application	Goal Achievement	both	2	{{NAME}} set a goal but keeps missing it. Which is the MOST likely reason?	NAME	goal_was_too_vague_or_no_plan_for_obstacles	not_trying_hard_enough_or_bad_luck	reason_choice	25	20	false	Vague goals and no obstacle planning account for most goal failures.	Goal failure is almost never about motivation or effort — it is almost always about specificity and obstacle preparation. This is fixable.	goals, failure, planning, obstacles
GB-068	Real-World Application	Household Management	adult	1	{{NAME}} picks up a piece of post. According to the one-touch rule, what should happen next?	NAME	deal_with_it_now_file_bin_or_act	put_it_down_to_deal_with_later	action_choice	10	20	false	One touch means full handling — not setting it down to handle twice.	The one-touch rule eliminates the pile of "I'll deal with it later" items that drain cognitive bandwidth every time they are seen.	household, organisation, adult, one-touch
GB-069	Real-World Application	Sleep Hygiene	both	1	{{NAME}} wants to be asleep by {{SLEEP_TIME}}. How many minutes before that should screens go off?	NAME,SLEEP_TIME	30_minutes_before	5_minutes_or_1_hour_or_right_at_bedtime	number	10	20	false	The brain needs about 30 minutes of screen-free wind-down before sleep.	Screen light suppresses melatonin production. A 30-minute screen-free window before target sleep time is one of the most evidence-based sleep hygiene habits.	sleep, screens, routine, hygiene
GB-070	Real-World Application	Financial Skills	adult	2	{{NAME}} earns {{INCOME}} per month. Their fixed costs are {{FIXED}} and variable costs average {{VARIABLE}}. How much is left over?	NAME,INCOME,FIXED,VARIABLE	income_minus_fixed_minus_variable	wrong_subtraction_results	number	25	20	false	Subtract both cost types from income to find what remains.	Basic budget arithmetic — income minus costs — is the foundation of financial self-management. Many people avoid this calculation entirely.	finances, budgeting, adult, arithmetic
GB-071	Real-World Application	Social Communication	both	2	{{NAME}} meets someone new called {{NEW_NAME}}. To remember the name, what should {{NAME}} do in the first 30 seconds?	NAME,NEW_NAME	say_their_name_back_in_a_sentence	just_nod_or_try_to_remember_later	action_choice	25	20	false	Using someone's name within 30 seconds dramatically improves recall.	Actively using a name immediately after hearing it engages both verbal and social working memory — the most effective name-learning technique.	social, names, memory, communication
GB-072	Working Memory	Dual Task	adult	3	While remembering this list — {{WORDS_3}} — answer this question: what is {{NUM1}} plus {{NUM2}}? Then recall the list.	WORDS_3,NUM1,NUM2,SUM	correct_sum_and_correct_list	wrong_sum_or_wrong_list	compound_answer	50	20	true	Hold the list in the background while solving the sum — then bring it forward.	Dual task performance — maintaining a memory load while solving a separate problem — is the highest working memory demand and directly mirrors real-life cognitive multitasking.	dual task, boss, working memory, adult
GB-073	Executive Function	Prioritisation	adult	3	{{NAME}} has 3 tasks: {{TASK}} (takes 2 hrs, high impact), {{TASK2}} (takes 10 mins, low impact), {{TASK3}} (takes 1 hr, medium impact). They have 90 minutes. What is the BEST choice?	NAME,TASK,TASK2,TASK3	task2_then_task3	only_task_or_only_task3	sequence_choice	50	22	true	Match available time to task duration AND impact — what fits AND matters most?	Time-constrained prioritisation requires combining duration, impact, and urgency simultaneously — a high-demand executive function task.	priority, time, boss, adult, impact
GB-074	Focus Stamina	Attention Recovery	both	3	You were counting backwards from {{START}} by {{STEP}}s. You got distracted and lost your place. You last remember saying {{LAST}}. What is the NEXT number?	START,STEP,LAST	last_minus_step	wrong_numbers	number	50	15	true	Subtract the step size from your last remembered number.	Recovering a mental count after distraction — rather than restarting — is a high-demand attention recovery skill that mirrors real-life focus recovery.	attention, recovery, counting, boss
GB-075	Emotional Regulation	Resilience	both	3	{{NAME}} has failed at {{TASK}} three times. Most people in this situation feel like giving up. What distinguishes a resilient response from a non-resilient one?	NAME,TASK	adjust_approach_and_try_again_vs_same_approach_or_quit	it_feels_easy_or_emotion_is_absent	distinction_choice	50	22	true	Resilience is not absence of emotion — it is action taken despite it.	Resilience is defined by behaviour, not feeling. The resilient person feels the same discouragement — but acts differently in response to it.	resilience, boss, failure, mindset
GB-076	Technical Planning	Critical Path	adult	3	A project has 5 steps. Steps 2 and 3 can run in parallel. Step 4 needs both 2 and 3 to finish. Step 5 needs step 4. Step 1 must come first. Which step is on the critical path that determines earliest completion?	none	steps_1_2or3_4_5_in_sequence	all_steps_or_only_parallel_steps	path_description	50	25	true	The critical path is the longest chain where each step depends on the last.	Critical path analysis is the most powerful planning tool for complex tasks — identifying which steps cannot be shortened without delaying the whole project.	planning, critical path, boss, adult, advanced
GB-077	Impulse Management	Urge Surfing	adult	3	An urge to do something impulsive appeared {{MINS_AGO}} minutes ago. Research shows urges typically peak at 3–5 minutes. Based on this, what is the urge MOST likely doing now?	MINS_AGO	fading_or_past_its_peak	growing_stronger_or_unchanged	state_choice	50	20	true	Urges are waves — they rise, peak, and fall. Time is the tool.	The neuroscience of urge surfing shows that most cravings and impulses follow a wave pattern. Waiting 5–10 minutes is often sufficient for the intensity to drop significantly.	impulse, urge surfing, boss, adult, neuroscience
GB-078	Emotional Regulation	Complex Regulation	adult	3	{{NAME}} feels both anxious AND excited about {{EVENT}}. These feel contradictory. What is the MOST accurate description of this state?	NAME,EVENT	ambivalent_or_mixed_emotions_are_normal_and_common	confused_or_one_emotion_is_wrong	description_choice	50	22	true	Two apparently opposite emotions can coexist — this is not a contradiction.	Emotional ambivalence — feeling two conflicting emotions simultaneously — is extremely common and neurologically normal. Recognising it reduces confusion and improves emotional literacy.	emotions, ambivalence, boss, adult, advanced
GB-079	Real-World Application	Complex Planning	adult	3	{{NAME}} has a project due in {{DAYS}} days. It has {{STEPS}} steps. {{BLOCKED_STEPS}} steps cannot start until an external response arrives in {{WAIT_DAYS}} days. How many steps can start TODAY?	NAME,DAYS,STEPS,BLOCKED_STEPS,WAIT_DAYS	steps_minus_blocked_steps	wrong_counts	number	50	22	true	Subtract the blocked steps from the total — what remains can start now.	Complex project planning requires identifying what can start immediately versus what must wait — this prevents the paralysis of treating a partially blocked project as fully blocked.	planning, boss, adult, complex, projects
GB-080	Working Memory	Compound Recall	both	3	Earlier in this session you were shown: {{WORDS_3}}. AND separately: {{NUMBERS_3}}. Which of these correctly lists BOTH in original order?	WORDS_3,NUMBERS_3	correct_combined_ordered_list	partial_or_reordered_combinations	compound_list	50	25	true	You need both lists in original order — words first, then numbers.	Recalling two separate memory loads from within a session tests the limits of working memory capacity and the ability to maintain multiple independent sequences simultaneously.	working memory, compound, boss, recall, advanced
